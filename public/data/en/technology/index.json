    "summary": "According to Outlook India, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivered a keynote speech at the \"AI Impact Summit 2026\" in New Delhi, India. At the summit, Altman formally called for the establishment of a global AI regulatory body to address the growing technological risks. He made a striking prediction: by 2028, most of the world's intellectual capacity will reside in data centers. Altman emphasized that with superintelligence potentially emerging in the coming years, society needs time to integrate and understand each technological stage. The international community must remain humble about the still-undefined risks and establish collaborative governance frameworks as early as possible. Furthermore, the summit also discussed the pressures AI development will place on water resources and its potential to boost global employment.",
