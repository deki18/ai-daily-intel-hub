In the Middle East, the situation between the US and Iran is on the brink of war due to the approach of a large fleet and Iran's live-fire exercises; while in East Asia, political dialogue and maritime friction coexist in the South China Sea, reflecting the complexity of great power rivalry.

China accused the Philippines of \"delusional infringement\" during its exercises at Scarborough Shoal, while the Philippines claimed its aircraft were subjected to close-range interference from Chinese helicopters during its mission. As the new chair of ASEAN, the Philippines reiterated its hope to complete COC negotiations by 2026 despite existing differences and its firm commitment to upholding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] The Manila Times: https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/31/news/china-resume-talks-to-ease-tensions/2268386\n  - [2] Global Times: https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/diplomacy/\n\n### China vows to purge its military of \"corrupt officials\": severely punish those who illegally embezzle military funds.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: Bloomberg, SCMP\n- **Summary**: According to reports from Bloomberg and the South China Morning Post, the Chinese government is intensifying its anti-corruption purge within the military, focusing on cracking down on \"parasites\" who illegally embezzle military funds. Two senior generals have recently been investigated for suspected corruption. The reports analyze that against the backdrop of escalating strategic competition, China is strengthening the auditing and control of military budgets to ensure the effective use of resources. This move is seen by the outside world as the latest signal of Chinese leaders' deep-seated rectification of internal problems within the People's Liberation Army, aiming to enhance the substantive combat effectiveness of the troops by strengthening integrity.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/sitemap_news.xml\n  - [2] SCMP: https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations\n\n### Taiwan publicly displays attack drones for the first time to deter mainland China.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to the latest news obtained by this station, the Taiwanese military recently publicly showcased its newly developed swarm of attack drones for the first time.

Rudd stated that the U.S. military has dispatched liaison officers to these key allies to jointly address cyber threats targeting the Indo-Pacific region through joint exercises and ongoing technical interactions. This move is seen as part of the U.S. \"Integrated Deterrence\" strategy, aimed at significantly enhancing collective defense against regional aggression and cyber infiltration through multilateral cooperation.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] Taipei Times: https://www.taipeitimes.com/\n\n### Japan and the Philippines signed a reciprocal defense agreement; the US expanded its base in Kenya to strengthen its global presence.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: The Defense Post, AP, Wikipedia\n- **Summary**: In the realm of global defense cooperation, several important agreements were reached in the past 24 hours.

Furthermore, the Trump administration is pushing to revoke the US market approval for certain Canadian aircraft models. This statement has triggered high alert in Canada and caused volatility in financial markets.

The core of this policy is to impose high punitive tariffs on all countries that supply oil to Cuba, aiming to completely cut off Cuba's energy supply lines. Cuban Foreign Minister Rodriguez subsequently issued a stern statement condemning the move as a \"comprehensive fuel blockade.\" This is seen as a continuation of the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" strategy in Latin America, potentially pushing Cuba's already fragile economy to the brink of collapse. International reactions to this decision, which could lead to a humanitarian crisis, have been mixed.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] UPI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### G7 foreign ministers' summit supports Middle East ceasefire plan: condemns Russian attack on Ukrainian energy facilities.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: Mirage News, WAM, US State Department\n- **Summary**: At the G7 foreign ministers' summit in Niagara, the G7 issued a joint statement reaffirming its common position on several global hotspots.

This ruling is widely seen as a major success for US foreign policy, aimed at weakening China's influence over the Panama Canal, a globally strategic waterway. With the ruling in effect, the ownership of the terminal's operation will once again enter a phase of international competition. This is not merely a dispute over a commercial contract, but a microcosm of the power struggle among major powers at a crucial geopolitical juncture.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] Taipei Times: https://www.taipeitimes.com/\n\n### Vietnam and the United States hold trade negotiations: Propose zero tariffs on key goods\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: The Investor\n- **Summary**: Vietnam is actively strengthening its economic and trade ties with the United States.

However, this policy direction has led to the yield on Japanese 10-year government bonds reaching a near-century high. Data from the Ministry of Finance shows that despite depreciation pressure on the yen, Japan has not directly intervened in the foreign exchange market in the past four weeks. Takaichi has also recently held intensive meetings with US and South Korean officials, attempting to mitigate domestic financial risks by strengthening geopolitical alliances amidst Japan's waning regional influence. This risky economic move by Japan has drawn significant attention from the International Monetary Fund.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] Japan Times: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/\n  - [2] Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/sitemap_news.xml\n\n### Global defense budgets surge: AI and autonomous weapon systems enter a period of deep integration\n- **Time**: 2026-01-30\n- **Source**: Forbes, GlobeNewswire\n- **Summary**: According to a recent Forbes analysis, global defense spending is projected to surge by trillions of dollars this year.
