US President Trump claimed that the US military used a secret weapon called the \"Discombobulator\" to successfully cripple Venezuela's defense systems and arrest Maduro and his wife. Maduro has now been transferred to a New York court for trial. As a result, the Venezuelan interim government declared a national state of emergency and filed a complaint with the UN Security Council accusing the US of \"military aggression\" aimed at plundering oil resources. Meanwhile, US diplomats have arrived in Caracas, preparing to reopen the embassy, which has been closed for seven years. Chinese media strongly condemned this move, criticizing it as a manifestation of a \"new Monroe Doctrine\" and an attempt to undermine regional peace.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] Anadolu: https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-military-action-on-maduro-driven-by-natural-resources-venezuela-tells-un/3790730\n  - [2] NPR: https://www.npr.org/2026/02/01/nx-s1-5686737/venezuela-maduro-trump-oil-houston\n\n### China and Russia strengthen defense cooperation to counter US strategic moves in Greenland and Venezuela.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-01\n- **Source**: South China Morning Post, Khaleej Times\n- **Summary**: According to the South China Morning Post, the defense ministers of China and Russia held a high-level meeting in Beijing on February 1st in response to the recent US military operations in Venezuela and its territorial ambitions regarding Greenland.

Data shows that the number of Russian military deaths reached 35,000 by December 2025, while Ukraine plans to push that number up to 50,000 per month by the summer of 2026. The main reason for the high casualties is the comprehensive upgrade of the Ukrainian military's drone tactics. Currently, the Russian military's losses are approaching its recruitment levels, and if this trend continues, the Kremlin may be forced to launch a new round of large-scale military mobilization. Although Russia is currently offering high bonuses to attract new recruits, the harsh reality on the front lines is posing a serious challenge to this model.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] The Japan Times: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/01/world/russia-war-deaths-recruitment/\n\n### US-Iran relations are now on a \"dual-track\" path: diplomatic engagement and military standoff coexist.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-01\n- **Source**: Israel Today, AZƏRBAYCAN24\n- **Summary**: Observing the situation in the Middle East, a dangerous balancing act is unfolding between the US and Iran.
