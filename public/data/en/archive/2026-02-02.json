With neither Washington nor Moscow expressing a clear willingness to renew, analysts worry that the treaty's termination could usher in an era of nuclear arms race completely unrestricted by law. Previously, Russia had proposed a brief extension, but the Trump administration, adhering to its \"America First\" policy, preferred to break free from traditional multilateral arms control constraints. This move has raised deep concerns from the United Nations and other parties, who fear it could trigger a new Cold War-style nuclear arms race.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [台北时报](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2026/02/02/2003851637)\n\n### 9.

This arms sale includes advanced missile interception systems and tactical fighter jet components. Analysts point out that this is not merely an economic transaction, but a key step in the US reshaping the Middle East security architecture, indicating that the concept of a \"mini-NATO\" in the Middle East is accelerating.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [台北时报](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front)\n  - [2] [先驱报](https://dailypioneer.com/news/gaza-border-crossing-buzzes-after-years-of-near-complete-closure)\n\n### 10.

Defense experts point out that with the development of physical simulation models like Google's DeepMind, AI-driven 'Hyperwar' may soon become a reality. In this mode of warfare, AI will be responsible for all tactical decisions and autonomous weapon deployments, with decision-making speeds far exceeding those of human commanders. Currently, the Pentagon has urgently accelerated the upgrading of its AI defense strategies to address potential digital military threats.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/01/opensource_ai_is_a_global/)\n  - [2] [福布斯](https://www.forbes.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n\n### 12.

It is understood that the core issue discussed was developing a comprehensive, coordinated defense and counterattack plan in response to a potential retaliatory strike from Iran. In retaliation, the Iranian government has declared EU member states' armed forces as \"terrorist organizations\" and ordered relevant military attachés stationed in Iran to leave the country within a specified period. Analysts believe that this move by Israel is a final military preparation for a potential regional conflict, and that intelligence sharing and tactical coordination between the US and Israel have reached their highest level since the Cold War.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [新华社](https://t.me/s/xinhua_news_agency_en)\n  - [2] [Azerbaijan24](https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/japan-pm-takaichi-s-party-poised-for-landslide-victory/)\n\n### 15.

Even more surprising is the news that diplomatic sources indicate the British and French governments are privately discussing deploying ground troops to Ukraine to maintain regional stability and monitor the ceasefire should a ceasefire be reached. Although this proposal is currently in the preliminary discussion stage and faces significant diplomatic risks, the signal it sends regarding the deep involvement of NATO member states in the Eastern European situation cannot be ignored.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [台北时报](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front)\n  - [2] [独立报](https://www.independent.co.uk/sitemaps/googlenews)\n\n### 16.

Analysts point out that if this alliance takes shape, it will profoundly alter the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and South Asia, giving these three regional powers greater collective bargaining power and autonomy in the face of great power rivalry.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [商业标准报](https://www.tbsnews.net/thoughts/muslim-nato-looks-change-game-gulf-1344076)\n\n### 17. Satellite images show the existence of a secret airbase in Egypt, suspected of supporting drone warfare within Sudan.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-01\n- **Source**: 纽约时报, CBS News\n- **Summary**: According to the New York Times, citing the latest satellite images provided by Ursa Space, an undisclosed airbase exists in the desert region of Egypt near the Sudanese border. Image analysis experts point out that the base is equipped with advanced drones, and their flight paths indicate that they are frequently involved in tactical strike operations during the Sudanese civil war. Although the Egyptian government has consistently maintained its neutrality in the Sudanese civil war, this evidence suggests that Egypt may be secretly supporting the Sudanese government forces to curb the expansion of paramilitary forces (RSF). Currently, the United Nations has warned that famine and massacres in Sudan are leading to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [纽约时报](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html)\n  - [2] [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/sudan/)\n\n### 18.

Yar Maro, leader of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group, vehemently denied government accusations of civilian massacres by his forces during an interview in a jungle hideout. He claimed he was fighting for the Oromo people's right to political self-determination and blamed the violence on out-of-control criminal groups. However, a report by the International Crisis Group indicates that the region is facing widespread assassinations, kidnappings, and torture. The standoff between government forces and militants has created a severe security vacuum, plunging local residents into extreme insecurity.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CityNews](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2026/02/02/executions-torture-abductions-rape-ethiopias-hidden-conflict/)\n  - [2] [美联社](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2026/02/02/ap-news-in-brief-at-1204-a-m-est-781/)\n\n### 19.

In response to the Trump administration's threat of 25% tariffs, South Korea's ruling party is urgently pushing forward a $350 billion investment bill in the U.S., attempting to appease Washington through a \"security for economic gain\" strategy. Meanwhile, the debate within South Korea regarding the reinstatement of the September 19 military agreement is intensifying, with the opposition accusing the government of weakening the country's overall defense capabilities through unilateral concessions on North Korea.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [KBS World](http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_list.htm/inc/news_view.htm?lang=e&Seq_Code=132912)\n  - [2] [UPI](https://www.upi.com/Korea-Regional-Review/Directors-Corner/Korean-News-Commentary-2026-02-01)\n\n### 20. 2026 Global Firepower Rankings Released: US, China, and Russia Remain in the Top Three, South Korea Shows Significant Improvement\n- **Time**: 2026-02-02\n- **Source**: Global Firepower\n- **Summary**: According to the 2026 Global Conventional Military Power Ranking released by the well-known defense assessment agency Global Firepower (GFP), the United States remains at the top, followed by China and Russia. The ranking comprehensively assesses more than 60 indicators, including conventional weapons stockpiles, human resources, logistical capabilities, and geographical factors, across 145 countries worldwide. Notably, South Korea saw a significant rise in its ranking due to its continued military expansion and strong performance in exporting advanced weapons.

The report points out that since railways are a vital artery for transporting Western aid weapons to Ukraine, such targeted attacks are causing severe delays in frontline supplies. Furthermore, the ethical and role of civilian satellite technology in military conflicts has once again become a focus of international attention. The Pentagon and Starlink service providers have not yet issued official comments on these allegations, but electronic warfare on the front lines has clearly entered the satellite realm.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Pronorus](https://pronorus.com/load/jurij_podoljaka/jurij_podoljaka_i_jurij_onufrienko_02_02_2026_poslednij_vypusk_svodka_svo_sobytija_na_frontakh/3-1-0-25374)\n  - [2] [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/us-iran-tensions/)\n\n### 22.

Compared to interceptor missiles that cost millions of dollars, the cost of a single interception with a laser system is only a few dollars, and it boasts an almost unlimited \"ammunition arsenal.\" Furthermore, European countries such as Poland are accelerating the procurement of similar low-cost interception systems. Defense experts believe that the maturity of this low-cost defense technology will be a key means of countering the threat of future AI \"swarm warfare,\" marking a profound transformation in the defense industry from expensive precision strikes to cost-effective attrition warfare.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [福布斯](https://www.forbes.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n  - [2] [China Military](http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/)",
