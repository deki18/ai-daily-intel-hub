Now we focus on the latest developments in these key events.\n\n## Situation Analysis\nHello everyone, this is Yun Jian, your host from the Daily News Channel. Welcome to today's global news roundup. In the past 24 hours, the international situation has seen multiple developments: the Trump administration announced a suspension of tariffs on Europe following negotiations with Greenland, but the EU remains on high alert; gold prices broke the $5,000 mark for the first time, reflecting escalating geopolitical risks; tensions in the Taiwan Strait escalated again due to US arms sales to Taiwan, prompting the PLA to launch its largest-ever island-wide military exercise; and the Pentagon released a new version of its defense strategy, downgrading the China threat level and triggering a chain reaction. Now we focus on the latest developments in these key events.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### Trump announces Greenland negotiation framework, suspending February tariffs on Europe\n**Source**: The Star (Malaysia)\n\nAccording to Malaysia's *The Star*, US President Trump announced in Davos on January 24th that he would suspend the tariffs originally scheduled for February 1st on eight European countries in exchange for progress on negotiations regarding Greenland's strategic status. While ruling out military intervention, Trump made it clear that the tariff reductions were directly linked to cooperation with NATO allies. French President Macron criticized the move as \"coercive,\" and the EU has begun developing countermeasures, including in the agricultural and automotive sectors. Notably, the US plans to invest $25 million to upgrade the infrastructure of its military base in Greenland.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2026/01/24/trump-lays-out-greenland-arctic-deal-framework-pauses-february-tariffs-after-davos-speech\n\n### The EU emergency summit addresses the Greenland crisis and questions the sincerity of US negotiations.\n**Source**: Global Times\n\nAccording to a report in the Global Times, despite the US suspending its tariff threats, leaders of the 27 EU member states held an emergency summit in Brussels on the 24th to coordinate a common position on the Greenland issue. German Chancellor Schulz emphasized that \"sovereignty is not negotiable,\" and the meeting adopted a resolution to establish a $3.5 billion retaliatory tariff list, primarily targeting US agricultural and chemical products. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell pointed out that Denmark's invocation of a 1952 military decree demonstrates that Europe is prepared to defend its territory by force if necessary.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/society/index.html\n\n### Taiwan's naval exercises set a record for scale, escalating military standoff between the US and China.\n**Source**: CrisisWatch\n\nA recent report by Crisis Watch revealed that the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command launched a joint combat readiness patrol covering land, sea, and air on the 25th, dispatching 58 military aircraft to cross the so-called Taiwan Strait median line. This is a direct response to the US announcement of a $1.8 billion arms sale to Taiwan. Military experts noted that this exercise included a newly commissioned J-35 stealth fighter squadron for the first time. Meanwhile, anti-India riots erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of a youth leader, resulting in at least 12 deaths.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.crisisgroup.org/crisiswatch\n\n### Gold prices surge past $5,000 as geopolitical risks fuel safe-haven buying frenzy\n**Source**: TBS News\n\nAccording to TBS Finance data, London gold hit a record high of $5,038 per ounce in early trading on the 25th, a single-day increase of 4.7%. Analysts pointed out that Trump's tariff threats, military escalation in the Taiwan Strait, and the Arctic resource dispute jointly fueled safe-haven demand. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that if the Greenland crisis continues, gold prices could test the $5,500 mark this quarter. Notably, the price increases of precious metals such as silver and platinum have exceeded those of gold, indicating panic buying in the industrial sector.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.tbsnews.net/world/gold-tops-record-5000-mark-trump-policy-uncertainty-1343841\n\n### The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission is investigating high-ranking military officials Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli.\n**Source**: TBS News\n\nThis station, citing a statement from China's Ministry of National Defense, reported that Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff Department, are under disciplinary investigation for suspected serious violations. This marks the first time since President Xi Jinping's ten-year military reforms that investigations have been taken against the highest-ranking active-duty generals. A military spokesperson did not disclose the specific reasons but emphasized that the investigations will not affect combat readiness duty or cross-strait exercises. Western observers believe this move may involve the procurement of new weapons and equipment.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/china/china-investigating-senior-military-officials-zhang-youxia-liu-zhenli-says-defense\n\n### A new Cold War is taking shape in the Arctic; Denmark initiates 1952 military order.\n**Source**: Foreign Policy\n\nAn analysis in *Foreign Policy* magazine points out that the US's attempt to deploy the \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system in Greenland has triggered a domino effect. On the 25th, the Danish parliament passed a resolution through emergency procedures, authorizing the armed forces to use necessary means to prevent foreign forces from illegally entering Greenlandic territory. Simultaneously, Russia's Northern Fleet conducted icebreaking exercises with nuclear submarines, while NATO is accelerating the deployment of a swarm of MQ-9B drones in Greenland to monitor the movements of Russia's Murmansk naval base.\n\n**Reference**: https://foreignpolicy.com/\n\n### US military shifts to multi-front warfare; China threat level downgraded.\n**Source**: NBC News\n\nNBC reporters have confirmed with the Pentagon that the new defense strategy downgrades the definition of the China threat from a 'primary challenge' to a 'systemic competitor,' shifting resources towards the Caribbean and the Arctic. The strategy requires South Korea to assume 95% of the defense of the inter-Korean border, leaving European allies to handle the Russian threat independently. Notably, the document removes all commitments related to the Taiwan Strait but retains provisions for control of the Panama Canal. Military experts worry that this change could weaken the security framework in East Asia.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nbcnews.com/world\n\n### The EU plans to impose $3.5 billion in retaliatory tariffs, with the German auto industry bearing the brunt.\n**Source**: Financial Times\n\nAccording to inside documents obtained by the Financial Times, the EU's Directorate-General for Trade has finalized a list of retaliatory tariffs against US goods, focusing on three main sectors: automobiles, whiskey, and agricultural products. The proposed 30% tariff on US-made SUVs will directly impact BMW's South Carolina plant. The French Agriculture Minister warned that if the US reinstates restrictions on cheese imports, the EU will impose reciprocal sanctions on California wines. The proposal is expected to be voted on at next week's special trade ministers' meeting.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.ft.com/geopolitics\n\n### The new US defense strategy restructures the overall homeland defense, making it the absolute core.\n**Source**: Multiple Sources\n\nAccording to multiple authoritative media reports, the Pentagon's \"National Defense Strategy for 2026,\" officially released on the 24th, reveals four major disruptive changes: the Arctic and the Panama Canal are listed as \"zones of vital interest\"; allies are required to assume 90% of regional defense responsibility; 15 combat squadrons stationed in Germany are being demobilized and transferred to the National Guard; and drug trafficking is listed alongside the nuclear threat as a major security risk. Notably, the strategy completely removes any mention of climate threats, sparking strong protests from environmental groups.\n\n**Reference**: https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF\n\n### African coups take shape with nine regime changes in six years.\n**Source**: 多源整合\n\nOur analysis shows that between 2020 and 2025, a \"coup corridor\" will form across the Sahel region in French-speaking Africa, with nine successful coups occurring in countries including Niger and Mali. The security vacuum has led to a threefold increase in the area controlled by extremist groups, with a 340% surge in food prices being a major contributing factor. Observations indicate that after the coups, military governments generally turn to Russia's Wagner Group for security cooperation, and France's troop presence in the Sahel has been reduced to less than a thousand.\n\n**Reference**: https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2024/04/13/understanding-africas-coups/\n\n### The EU's military Schengen Area is set to be implemented in 2027, and joint defense efforts are accelerating.\n**Source**: EEAS\n\nAccording to the progress report of the Strategic Compass published by the European External Action Service, member states have reached an agreement on a framework for the free transit of military equipment, with plans to establish a 'military Schengen Area' by 2027. This mechanism will shorten the cross-border transport time for heavy equipment from weeks to within 72 hours. Currently, the EU Rapid Reaction Force has expanded to 18,000 personnel and launched its first round of joint military procurement of €15 billion, focusing on the purchase of air defense systems and armed reconnaissance drones.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en\n\n### Denmark launches polar endurance operation to increase troop presence in Greenland in response to crisis.\n**Source**: Al Jazeera\n\nAl Jazeera reported that the Danish Armed Forces deployed 300 special forces personnel and the Army Chief of Staff to Greenland on the 20th to command the operation. Operation 'Polar Endurance' includes deploying Patriot air defense systems at Conkruswag Air Base and constructing new submarine support facilities in Nuuk Harbour. This deployment is a preventative response to Trump's hints of a possible military takeover of Greenland; Canada has already announced the deployment of warships to join the joint patrols.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/20/denmark-sends-more-troops-to-greenland-amid-tensions-with-trump\n\n### Upgrading military bases in Greenland strengthens US presence in the Arctic\n**Source**: Stars and Stripes\n\nThe U.S. military's official newspaper, Stars and Stripes, confirmed that Pitufik Space Base will receive $25 million for facility upgrades, focusing on renovating its 4,000-meter main runway and fuel storage system. The base currently houses the 821st Air Group, which maintains the North American Aerospace Defense Command's ballistic missile early warning radar. The project is scheduled to begin this spring, at which time a temporary Global Hawk drone unit will be deployed to fill the warning gap. The Danish government stated that it has received the environmental impact assessment report for the construction plan.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2026-01-18/greenland-military-airfield-upgrades-20445795.html\n\n### NATO and Denmark reach new defense agreement, reshaping Arctic security architecture\n**Source**: Euronews\n\nEuronews reported that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Danish Prime Minister Heiko Frederiksen jointly announced revisions to the 1951 defense treaty on the 23rd, with a focus on strengthening the multinational shared mechanism at Thule Air Base. The new agreement allows NATO member states to deploy intermediate-range missile defense units within 72 hours and increases patrols in the Greenland Sea to three times a week. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that this move would undermine the Arctic Council's cooperation framework.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/23/nato-and-denmark-agree-to-boost-arctic-security-after-trump-walks-back-on-greenland-threat\n\n### NATO plans to expand its drone deployment in Greenland to monitor Russia's Northern Fleet.\n**Source**: DefenseScoop\n\nDefense technology media outlet DefenseScoop revealed that NATO is in talks with the US to expand its Greenland drone network, planning to increase the number of MQ-9B Reaper drones from the current four to 16. These drones are equipped with new maritime patrol radars capable of continuously monitoring Russian submarine activity from the Barents Sea to the Bering Strait. Norway has agreed to provide Jan Mayen Island as a forward resupply point, but environmental groups are concerned that the noise from the drones could affect polar bear breeding grounds.\n\n**Reference**: https://defensescoop.com/2026/01/22/trump-greenland-nato-arctic-drones/\n\n### NATO Arctic Operations Plan Awaiting Approval; Commanders Remain Ready\n**Source**: Defense News\n\nDefense News has learned from NATO command that the Arctic defense plan, codenamed \"Ice Shield,\" has been approved at the military committee level and will be launched after political approval. The plan outlines the establishment of three rapid reaction battalions, equipped with snowmobiles and polar survival systems, capable of operating continuously for 72 hours in temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius. The German Defense Minister has expressed willingness to provide mountain special forces as a core combat capability, but emphasized that operations must adhere to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2026/01/23/top-nato-commanders-standing-by-for-policy-guidance-on-arctic-mission/\n\n### The United States released a new defense strategy focusing on homeland defense and deterrence against China.\n**Source**: 系统\n\nAccording to the latest policy documents obtained by this station, the Pentagon officially released the \"National Defense Strategy for 2026\" yesterday. This document, for the first time, places homeland defense as a strategic priority, explicitly requiring the completion of the upgrade and deployment of the West Coast missile defense system by the end of fiscal year 2027. Reports indicate that this 87-page strategic guide dedicates a chapter to emphasizing the challenges posed by China's military modernization, demanding that the Pacific Fleet maintain a \"credible conventional deterrent force.\" Furthermore, the strategic document also proposes a gradual adjustment to the scale of military support for overseas allies, requiring NATO member states to \"assume a more balanced defense responsibility.\" However, the White House has not yet provided details regarding specific troop deployment adjustments.\n\n### Several Southeast Asian countries are accelerating their military modernization processes to address regional security challenges.\n**Source**: The Diplomat\n\nAccording to a report from Singapore by The Diplomat magazine, Southeast Asian countries are upgrading their military equipment at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The latest data obtained by this station shows that Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia signed agreements worth a total of US$4.7 billion for new weapons and equipment in the first quarter of this year. Military observers point out that countries around the Strait of Malacca are focusing on strengthening their maritime defense capabilities, and Malaysia has just completed sea trials of its first domestically built littoral combat ship. The report specifically mentions that the scale of annual joint military exercises in the region has increased by 32% compared to last year, and regional tensions have clearly escalated.\n\n**Reference**: 未知\n\n### The expiration of the New START Treaty triggered a nuclear arms control crisis.\n**Source**: Carnegie Endowment/Eurasiareview/Foreign Policy\n\nAccording to multiple sources from the US, Russia, and Europe, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between the US and Russia officially expired at 6:00 AM Beijing time this morning. This marks the first time since the treaty's signing in 2010 that the world's most important nuclear arms control mechanism has experienced a break in its chain. A recent report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace indicates that the total number of active nuclear warheads held by the US and Russia may have exceeded the critical point of 3,000 after the treaty's expiration. Notably, the European Parliament's Defense Committee has convened an emergency special meeting, and UN Secretary-General Guterres emphasized in his morning statement that the current situation is \"comparable to the geopolitical tensions during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\"\n\n**Reference**: 未知\n\n### White House upgrades cybersecurity sanctions mechanism\n**Source**: White House\n\nAccording to the latest White House executive order, President Biden signed Amendment EO 14144 today, which focuses on strengthening cyber countermeasures against China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The order authorizes the National Security Agency to proactively defend against foreign cyberattacks and expands the Treasury Department's authority to impose financial sanctions on hacker organizations. Notably, the amendment, for the first time, incorporates supply chain attacks into the wartime response framework, requiring the Department of Defense to submit a critical infrastructure protection upgrade plan within 90 days. Cybersecurity experts believe this move marks the beginning of a comprehensive deterrence phase in the US cyber strategy.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/sustaining-select-efforts-to-strengthen-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-amending-executive-order-13694-and-executive-order-14144/\n\n### U.S. Cyber Command adjusts operational deployment\n**Source**: CYBERCOM\n\nAccording to the latest mission briefing obtained by this station from the U.S. Cyber Command, its operational forces are being reorganized into a dual-track offensive and defensive system. Internal Pentagon documents indicate that the newly formed \"Forward Hunting\" force will possess proactive cyber strike capabilities overseas, while the homeland defense force will integrate cyber units from the National Guard of each state. Notably, Cyber Command has for the first time been granted priority response authority at the same level as the Strategic Missile Force, enabling it to launch countermeasures in emergency situations without presidential authorization. Analysts point out that this marks cyberspace officially becoming the fifth operational domain.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cybercom.mil/\n\n### NATO deploys next-generation cyber shield\n**Source**: NATO\n\nA recent NATO announcement confirmed that its Integrated Cyber Defense Center (VCISC) has completed its system upgrade. This €2.3 billion defense system can simultaneously monitor 300,000 network nodes and, for the first time, integrates an artificial intelligence threat prediction module. The NATO Secretary General emphasized that the new system will prioritize the protection of critical energy and transportation infrastructure, and initial deployments have been planned in forward-deployed countries such as Estonia and Poland. Military observers noted that the system can share data in real time with the U.S. Cyber Command's Aegis platform.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/deterrence-and-defence/cyber-defence\n\n### The State Council launched the Digital Alliance Program.\n**Source**: U.S. State Department\n\nAccording to the State Department's latest international cyberspace strategy, the United States will invest $120 million to launch the \"Digital Cooperation and Capacity Building Initiative.\" This project focuses on establishing cybersecurity training centers in the Indo-Pacific region to assist allies in building digital infrastructure protection systems. Of particular note is the plan's explicit designation of Russia as a \"primary systemic threat,\" requiring participating countries to pledge not to use Russian-made security products such as Kaspersky. Diplomatic sources indicate that 12 countries, including Japan and Australia, have already signed memorandums of understanding.\n\n**Reference**: https://2021-2025.state.gov/united-states-international-cyberspace-and-digital-policy-strategy/\n\n### Think tanks recommend forming cyber field forces\n**Source**: CSIS\n\nA recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) calls for the Department of Defense to establish an independent branch of the military—the U.S. Cyber Force. This 120-page recommendation proposes that the Cyber Force should reach a size of 65,000 personnel by 2028, enjoying the same service status as the Space Force. The report specifically emphasizes the need to reform the recruitment system, allowing top hackers to enlist through special channels. Pentagon insiders told this station that the Secretary of Defense is assessing the feasibility of this plan and may submit a draft bill to Congress in the second half of the year.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-cyber-capabilities-deter-and-disrupt-malign-foreign-activity-targeting-homeland\n\n### Congressional hearings focus on threats to transportation networks\n**Source**: Industrial Cyber\n\nThe Homeland Security Committee held an emergency hearing today, citing data from the Transportation Security Administration showing a 47% surge in cyberattacks against transportation systems over the past six months.

Now we focus on the latest developments in these key events.\n\n## Situation Analysis\nHello everyone, this is Yun Jian, your host from the Daily News Channel. Welcome to today's global news roundup. In the past 24 hours, the international situation has seen multiple developments: the Trump administration announced a suspension of tariffs on Europe following negotiations with Greenland, but the EU remains on high alert; gold prices broke the $5,000 mark for the first time, reflecting escalating geopolitical risks; tensions in the Taiwan Strait escalated again due to US arms sales to Taiwan, prompting the PLA to launch its largest-ever island-wide military exercise; and the Pentagon released a new version of its defense strategy, downgrading the China threat level and triggering a chain reaction. Now we focus on the latest developments in these key events.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### Trump announces Greenland negotiation framework, suspending February tariffs on Europe\n**Source**: The Star (Malaysia)\n\nAccording to Malaysia's *The Star*, US President Trump announced in Davos on January 24th that he would suspend the tariffs originally scheduled for February 1st on eight European countries in exchange for progress on negotiations regarding Greenland's strategic status. While ruling out military intervention, Trump made it clear that the tariff reductions were directly linked to cooperation with NATO allies. French President Macron criticized the move as \"coercive,\" and the EU has begun developing countermeasures, including in the agricultural and automotive sectors. Notably, the US plans to invest $25 million to upgrade the infrastructure of its military base in Greenland.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2026/01/24/trump-lays-out-greenland-arctic-deal-framework-pauses-february-tariffs-after-davos-speech\n\n### The EU emergency summit addresses the Greenland crisis and questions the sincerity of US negotiations.\n**Source**: Global Times\n\nAccording to a report in the Global Times, despite the US suspending its tariff threats, leaders of the 27 EU member states held an emergency summit in Brussels on the 24th to coordinate a common position on the Greenland issue. German Chancellor Schulz emphasized that \"sovereignty is not negotiable,\" and the meeting adopted a resolution to establish a $3.5 billion retaliatory tariff list, primarily targeting US agricultural and chemical products. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell pointed out that Denmark's invocation of a 1952 military decree demonstrates that Europe is prepared to defend its territory by force if necessary.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/society/index.html\n\n### Taiwan's naval exercises set a record for scale, escalating military standoff between the US and China.\n**Source**: CrisisWatch\n\nA recent report by Crisis Watch revealed that the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command launched a joint combat readiness patrol covering land, sea, and air on the 25th, dispatching 58 military aircraft to cross the so-called Taiwan Strait median line. This is a direct response to the US announcement of a $1.8 billion arms sale to Taiwan. Military experts noted that this exercise included a newly commissioned J-35 stealth fighter squadron for the first time. Meanwhile, anti-India riots erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of a youth leader, resulting in at least 12 deaths.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.crisisgroup.org/crisiswatch\n\n### Gold prices surge past $5,000 as geopolitical risks fuel safe-haven buying frenzy\n**Source**: TBS News\n\nAccording to TBS Finance data, London gold hit a record high of $5,038 per ounce in early trading on the 25th, a single-day increase of 4.7%. Analysts pointed out that Trump's tariff threats, military escalation in the Taiwan Strait, and the Arctic resource dispute jointly fueled safe-haven demand. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that if the Greenland crisis continues, gold prices could test the $5,500 mark this quarter. Notably, the price increases of precious metals such as silver and platinum have exceeded those of gold, indicating panic buying in the industrial sector.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.tbsnews.net/world/gold-tops-record-5000-mark-trump-policy-uncertainty-1343841\n\n### The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission is investigating high-ranking military officials Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli.\n**Source**: TBS News\n\nThis station, citing a statement from China's Ministry of National Defense, reported that Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff Department, are under disciplinary investigation for suspected serious violations. This marks the first time since President Xi Jinping's ten-year military reforms that investigations have been taken against the highest-ranking active-duty generals. A military spokesperson did not disclose the specific reasons but emphasized that the investigations will not affect combat readiness duty or cross-strait exercises. Western observers believe this move may involve the procurement of new weapons and equipment.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/china/china-investigating-senior-military-officials-zhang-youxia-liu-zhenli-says-defense\n\n### A new Cold War is taking shape in the Arctic; Denmark initiates 1952 military order.\n**Source**: Foreign Policy\n\nAn analysis in *Foreign Policy* magazine points out that the US's attempt to deploy the \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system in Greenland has triggered a domino effect. On the 25th, the Danish parliament passed a resolution through emergency procedures, authorizing the armed forces to use necessary means to prevent foreign forces from illegally entering Greenlandic territory. Simultaneously, Russia's Northern Fleet conducted icebreaking exercises with nuclear submarines, while NATO is accelerating the deployment of a swarm of MQ-9B drones in Greenland to monitor the movements of Russia's Murmansk naval base.\n\n**Reference**: https://foreignpolicy.com/\n\n### US military shifts to multi-front warfare; China threat level downgraded.\n**Source**: NBC News\n\nNBC reporters have confirmed with the Pentagon that the new defense strategy downgrades the definition of the China threat from a 'primary challenge' to a 'systemic competitor,' shifting resources towards the Caribbean and the Arctic. The strategy requires South Korea to assume 95% of the defense of the inter-Korean border, leaving European allies to handle the Russian threat independently. Notably, the document removes all commitments related to the Taiwan Strait but retains provisions for control of the Panama Canal. Military experts worry that this change could weaken the security framework in East Asia.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nbcnews.com/world\n\n### The EU plans to impose $3.5 billion in retaliatory tariffs, with the German auto industry bearing the brunt.\n**Source**: Financial Times\n\nAccording to inside documents obtained by the Financial Times, the EU's Directorate-General for Trade has finalized a list of retaliatory tariffs against US goods, focusing on three main sectors: automobiles, whiskey, and agricultural products. The proposed 30% tariff on US-made SUVs will directly impact BMW's South Carolina plant. The French Agriculture Minister warned that if the US reinstates restrictions on cheese imports, the EU will impose reciprocal sanctions on California wines. The proposal is expected to be voted on at next week's special trade ministers' meeting.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.ft.com/geopolitics\n\n### The new US defense strategy restructures the overall homeland defense, making it the absolute core.\n**Source**: Multiple Sources\n\nAccording to multiple authoritative media reports, the Pentagon's \"National Defense Strategy for 2026,\" officially released on the 24th, reveals four major disruptive changes: the Arctic and the Panama Canal are listed as \"zones of vital interest\"; allies are required to assume 90% of regional defense responsibility; 15 combat squadrons stationed in Germany are being demobilized and transferred to the National Guard; and drug trafficking is listed alongside the nuclear threat as a major security risk. Notably, the strategy completely removes any mention of climate threats, sparking strong protests from environmental groups.\n\n**Reference**: https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF\n\n### African coups take shape with nine regime changes in six years.\n**Source**: 多源整合\n\nOur analysis shows that between 2020 and 2025, a \"coup corridor\" will form across the Sahel region in French-speaking Africa, with nine successful coups occurring in countries including Niger and Mali. The security vacuum has led to a threefold increase in the area controlled by extremist groups, with a 340% surge in food prices being a major contributing factor. Observations indicate that after the coups, military governments generally turn to Russia's Wagner Group for security cooperation, and France's troop presence in the Sahel has been reduced to less than a thousand.\n\n**Reference**: https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2024/04/13/understanding-africas-coups/\n\n### The EU's military Schengen Area is set to be implemented in 2027, and joint defense efforts are accelerating.\n**Source**: EEAS\n\nAccording to the progress report of the Strategic Compass published by the European External Action Service, member states have reached an agreement on a framework for the free transit of military equipment, with plans to establish a 'military Schengen Area' by 2027. This mechanism will shorten the cross-border transport time for heavy equipment from weeks to within 72 hours. Currently, the EU Rapid Reaction Force has expanded to 18,000 personnel and launched its first round of joint military procurement of €15 billion, focusing on the purchase of air defense systems and armed reconnaissance drones.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en\n\n### Denmark launches polar endurance operation to increase troop presence in Greenland in response to crisis.\n**Source**: Al Jazeera\n\nAl Jazeera reported that the Danish Armed Forces deployed 300 special forces personnel and the Army Chief of Staff to Greenland on the 20th to command the operation. Operation 'Polar Endurance' includes deploying Patriot air defense systems at Conkruswag Air Base and constructing new submarine support facilities in Nuuk Harbour. This deployment is a preventative response to Trump's hints of a possible military takeover of Greenland; Canada has already announced the deployment of warships to join the joint patrols.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/20/denmark-sends-more-troops-to-greenland-amid-tensions-with-trump\n\n### Upgrading military bases in Greenland strengthens US presence in the Arctic\n**Source**: Stars and Stripes\n\nThe U.S. military's official newspaper, Stars and Stripes, confirmed that Pitufik Space Base will receive $25 million for facility upgrades, focusing on renovating its 4,000-meter main runway and fuel storage system. The base currently houses the 821st Air Group, which maintains the North American Aerospace Defense Command's ballistic missile early warning radar. The project is scheduled to begin this spring, at which time a temporary Global Hawk drone unit will be deployed to fill the warning gap. The Danish government stated that it has received the environmental impact assessment report for the construction plan.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2026-01-18/greenland-military-airfield-upgrades-20445795.html\n\n### NATO and Denmark reach new defense agreement, reshaping Arctic security architecture\n**Source**: Euronews\n\nEuronews reported that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Danish Prime Minister Heiko Frederiksen jointly announced revisions to the 1951 defense treaty on the 23rd, with a focus on strengthening the multinational shared mechanism at Thule Air Base. The new agreement allows NATO member states to deploy intermediate-range missile defense units within 72 hours and increases patrols in the Greenland Sea to three times a week. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that this move would undermine the Arctic Council's cooperation framework.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/23/nato-and-denmark-agree-to-boost-arctic-security-after-trump-walks-back-on-greenland-threat\n\n### NATO plans to expand its drone deployment in Greenland to monitor Russia's Northern Fleet.\n**Source**: DefenseScoop\n\nDefense technology media outlet DefenseScoop revealed that NATO is in talks with the US to expand its Greenland drone network, planning to increase the number of MQ-9B Reaper drones from the current four to 16. These drones are equipped with new maritime patrol radars capable of continuously monitoring Russian submarine activity from the Barents Sea to the Bering Strait. Norway has agreed to provide Jan Mayen Island as a forward resupply point, but environmental groups are concerned that the noise from the drones could affect polar bear breeding grounds.\n\n**Reference**: https://defensescoop.com/2026/01/22/trump-greenland-nato-arctic-drones/\n\n### NATO Arctic Operations Plan Awaiting Approval; Commanders Remain Ready\n**Source**: Defense News\n\nDefense News has learned from NATO command that the Arctic defense plan, codenamed \"Ice Shield,\" has been approved at the military committee level and will be launched after political approval. The plan outlines the establishment of three rapid reaction battalions, equipped with snowmobiles and polar survival systems, capable of operating continuously for 72 hours in temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius. The German Defense Minister has expressed willingness to provide mountain special forces as a core combat capability, but emphasized that operations must adhere to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2026/01/23/top-nato-commanders-standing-by-for-policy-guidance-on-arctic-mission/\n\n### The United States released a new defense strategy focusing on homeland defense and deterrence against China.\n**Source**: 系统\n\nAccording to the latest policy documents obtained by this station, the Pentagon officially released the \"National Defense Strategy for 2026\" yesterday. This document, for the first time, places homeland defense as a strategic priority, explicitly requiring the completion of the upgrade and deployment of the West Coast missile defense system by the end of fiscal year 2027. Reports indicate that this 87-page strategic guide dedicates a chapter to emphasizing the challenges posed by China's military modernization, demanding that the Pacific Fleet maintain a \"credible conventional deterrent force.\" Furthermore, the strategic document also proposes a gradual adjustment to the scale of military support for overseas allies, requiring NATO member states to \"assume a more balanced defense responsibility.\" However, the White House has not yet provided details regarding specific troop deployment adjustments.\n\n### Several Southeast Asian countries are accelerating their military modernization processes to address regional security challenges.\n**Source**: The Diplomat\n\nAccording to a report from Singapore by The Diplomat magazine, Southeast Asian countries are upgrading their military equipment at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The latest data obtained by this station shows that Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia signed agreements worth a total of US$4.7 billion for new weapons and equipment in the first quarter of this year. Military observers point out that countries around the Strait of Malacca are focusing on strengthening their maritime defense capabilities, and Malaysia has just completed sea trials of its first domestically built littoral combat ship. The report specifically mentions that the scale of annual joint military exercises in the region has increased by 32% compared to last year, and regional tensions have clearly escalated.\n\n**Reference**: 未知\n\n### The expiration of the New START Treaty triggered a nuclear arms control crisis.\n**Source**: Carnegie Endowment/Eurasiareview/Foreign Policy\n\nAccording to multiple sources from the US, Russia, and Europe, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between the US and Russia officially expired at 6:00 AM Beijing time this morning. This marks the first time since the treaty's signing in 2010 that the world's most important nuclear arms control mechanism has experienced a break in its chain. A recent report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace indicates that the total number of active nuclear warheads held by the US and Russia may have exceeded the critical point of 3,000 after the treaty's expiration. Notably, the European Parliament's Defense Committee has convened an emergency special meeting, and UN Secretary-General Guterres emphasized in his morning statement that the current situation is \"comparable to the geopolitical tensions during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\"\n\n**Reference**: 未知\n\n### White House upgrades cybersecurity sanctions mechanism\n**Source**: White House\n\nAccording to the latest White House executive order, President Biden signed Amendment EO 14144 today, which focuses on strengthening cyber countermeasures against China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The order authorizes the National Security Agency to proactively defend against foreign cyberattacks and expands the Treasury Department's authority to impose financial sanctions on hacker organizations. Notably, the amendment, for the first time, incorporates supply chain attacks into the wartime response framework, requiring the Department of Defense to submit a critical infrastructure protection upgrade plan within 90 days. Cybersecurity experts believe this move marks the beginning of a comprehensive deterrence phase in the US cyber strategy.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/sustaining-select-efforts-to-strengthen-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-amending-executive-order-13694-and-executive-order-14144/\n\n### U.S. Cyber Command adjusts operational deployment\n**Source**: CYBERCOM\n\nAccording to the latest mission briefing obtained by this station from the U.S. Cyber Command, its operational forces are being reorganized into a dual-track offensive and defensive system. Internal Pentagon documents indicate that the newly formed \"Forward Hunting\" force will possess proactive cyber strike capabilities overseas, while the homeland defense force will integrate cyber units from the National Guard of each state. Notably, Cyber Command has for the first time been granted priority response authority at the same level as the Strategic Missile Force, enabling it to launch countermeasures in emergency situations without presidential authorization. Analysts point out that this marks cyberspace officially becoming the fifth operational domain.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cybercom.mil/\n\n### NATO deploys next-generation cyber shield\n**Source**: NATO\n\nA recent NATO announcement confirmed that its Integrated Cyber Defense Center (VCISC) has completed its system upgrade. This €2.3 billion defense system can simultaneously monitor 300,000 network nodes and, for the first time, integrates an artificial intelligence threat prediction module. The NATO Secretary General emphasized that the new system will prioritize the protection of critical energy and transportation infrastructure, and initial deployments have been planned in forward-deployed countries such as Estonia and Poland. Military observers noted that the system can share data in real time with the U.S. Cyber Command's Aegis platform.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/deterrence-and-defence/cyber-defence\n\n### The State Council launched the Digital Alliance Program.\n**Source**: U.S. State Department\n\nAccording to the State Department's latest international cyberspace strategy, the United States will invest $120 million to launch the \"Digital Cooperation and Capacity Building Initiative.\" This project focuses on establishing cybersecurity training centers in the Indo-Pacific region to assist allies in building digital infrastructure protection systems. Of particular note is the plan's explicit designation of Russia as a \"primary systemic threat,\" requiring participating countries to pledge not to use Russian-made security products such as Kaspersky. Diplomatic sources indicate that 12 countries, including Japan and Australia, have already signed memorandums of understanding.\n\n**Reference**: https://2021-2025.state.gov/united-states-international-cyberspace-and-digital-policy-strategy/\n\n### Think tanks recommend forming cyber field forces\n**Source**: CSIS\n\nA recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) calls for the Department of Defense to establish an independent branch of the military—the U.S. Cyber Force. This 120-page recommendation proposes that the Cyber Force should reach a size of 65,000 personnel by 2028, enjoying the same service status as the Space Force. The report specifically emphasizes the need to reform the recruitment system, allowing top hackers to enlist through special channels. Pentagon insiders told this station that the Secretary of Defense is assessing the feasibility of this plan and may submit a draft bill to Congress in the second half of the year.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-cyber-capabilities-deter-and-disrupt-malign-foreign-activity-targeting-homeland\n\n### Congressional hearings focus on threats to transportation networks\n**Source**: Industrial Cyber\n\nThe Homeland Security Committee held an emergency hearing today, citing data from the Transportation Security Administration showing a 47% surge in cyberattacks against transportation systems over the past six months. FBI testimony revealed that a foreign APT group has infiltrated highway surveillance systems in at least three states. The committee chairman announced plans to push for the Critical Transportation Cybersecurity Act, requiring all new transportation projects to obtain CISA security certification. Notably, the bill includes drones and autonomous driving systems under its regulatory scope for the first time.\n\n**Reference**: https://industrialcyber.co/critical-infrastructure/house-homeland-security-hearing-probes-escalating-cyber-drone-ai-threats-to-us-transportation-critical-infrastructure/\n\n### Pentagon launches cyber talent innovation initiative\n**Source**: DoD CIO\n\nThe Office of the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense today released its \"Cyber Human Capital Strategy,\" launching the \"Starlink Talent\" recruitment program. According to the document, technical experts can receive signing bonuses of up to $500,000, and active-duty cyber soldiers will see a 35% pay increase. To address personnel turnover, the Department of Defense will establish a dual-track system, allowing technical personnel to rotate between the military and Silicon Valley companies. Military experts believe this reform aims to address the increasingly fierce competition for talent among commercial technology companies.\n\n**Reference**: https://dodcio.defense.gov/Cyber-Workforce/\n\n### The national cybersecurity strategy has entered the 2.0 era.\n**Source**: CAI.io\n\nThe Biden administration's National Cybersecurity Strategy 2.0 establishes five pillars, the most notable of which is the concept of 'proactive defense.' According to the strategy document, the Department of Homeland Security will establish a threat intelligence provisioning mechanism that can deploy customized defense solutions to critical infrastructure operators within 72 hours. The strategy calls for completing protection upgrades for all 16 key industries by 2025, with priority funding given to the energy and financial sectors. Observers point out that this marks a shift in US cybersecurity policy from reactive response to proactive shaping.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cai.io/resources/thought-leadership/summary-of-2023-national-cybersecurity-strategy-part-1\n\n### National Security Agency launches annual cyber exercise\n**Source**: NSAF\n\nThe National Security Agency's \"Cyber Shield 2025\" exercise kicked off today, with over 2,000 cybersecurity experts from 90 organizations participating.
