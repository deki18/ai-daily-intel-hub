In the past 24 hours, the international situation has seen multiple developments: the Trump administration announced a suspension of tariffs on Europe following negotiations with Greenland, but the EU remains on high alert; gold prices broke the $5,000 mark for the first time, reflecting escalating geopolitical risks; tensions in the Taiwan Strait escalated again due to US arms sales to Taiwan, prompting the PLA to launch its largest-ever island-wide military exercise; and the Pentagon released a new version of its defense strategy, downgrading the China threat level and triggering a chain reaction. Now we focus on the latest developments in these key events.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### Trump announces Greenland negotiation framework, suspending February tariffs on Europe\n- **Date**: 2026-01-24\n- **Source**: The Star (Malaysia)\n- **Summary**: According to Malaysia's *The Star*, US President Trump announced in Davos on January 24th that he would suspend the tariffs originally scheduled for February 1st on eight European countries in exchange for progress on negotiations regarding Greenland's strategic status. While ruling out military intervention, Trump made it clear that the tariff reductions were directly linked to cooperation with NATO allies. French President Macron criticized the move as \"coercive,\" and the EU has begun developing countermeasures, including in the agricultural and automotive sectors. Notably, the US plans to invest $25 million to upgrade the infrastructure of its military base in Greenland.\n- **Sources**:\n  - [1] The Star (Malaysia): https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2026/01/24/trump-lays-out-greenland-arctic-deal-framework-pauses-february-tariffs-after-davos-speech\n\n### The EU emergency summit addresses the Greenland crisis and questions the sincerity of US negotiations.\n- **Date**: 2026-01-24\n- **Source**: Global Times\n- **Summary**: According to a report in the Global Times, despite the US suspending its tariff threats, leaders of the 27 EU member states held an emergency summit in Brussels on the 24th to coordinate a common position on the Greenland issue.
