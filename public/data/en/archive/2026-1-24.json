Let's quickly review the important global events of the past 24 hours: The President of the European Council publicly questioned the compatibility of Trump's newly launched 'Peace Commission' with the UN Charter; NATO and the EU showed unprecedented unity on the Ukraine issue, while the French Navy took the rare step of seizing a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean; new variables emerged in the Middle East, with regime change in Syria disrupting the regional balance of power, and the UAE about to witness high-level trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US; the semiconductor industry faced another round of US tariffs, and geopolitical rifts are rapidly spreading to the technology sector. In this episode, we will take you deep into these key turning points.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### The European Union questions Trump's peace committee plan, claiming it may violate the UN Charter.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / European Council\n\nAccording to our station, European Council President António Costa issued a formal statement on the 23rd, expressing deep concern over Trump's \"Peace Commission\" initiative launched at the Davos Forum the previous day. In his briefing following the informal EU summit, Costa pointed out that while the EU is willing to cooperate in the Gaza peace process, the commission's scope of authority and operating mechanisms are fundamentally in conflict with UN Security Council Resolution 2803. This statement directly responds to Trump's Davos declaration that \"this body will benefit the UN.\" Documents disclosed concurrently with the meeting show that EU legal authorities are urgently assessing the commission's legal status.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2026/01/23/oral-conclusions-drawn-by-president-antonio-costa-following-the-informal-meeting-of-the-members-of-the-european-council-of-22-january-2026/\n\n### Trump's peace plan unveiled in Davos sparks sovereignty disputes over NATO's Arctic operations.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / Politico\n\nReports indicate that Trump signed the charter document for the Peace Commission during the World Economic Forum on the 23rd, inviting leaders from multiple countries, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, to join. However, concurrently, it was revealed that the NATO Military Committee was consulting with the Trump team on Greenland's Arctic defense plans, triggering a strong backlash from the Danish government. The Greenlandic Foreign Minister publicly stated that \"any unauthorized military deployment is a violation of sovereignty,\" and the Polish Prime Minister warned that the Trump administration was pursuing \"coercive diplomacy.\" Analysts point out that this incident will exacerbate strategic mistrust across the Atlantic.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/23/6-things-to-know-about-trumps-obsession-with-greenland-00744838,https://www.upi.com/sitemap_index.xml\n\n### A joint NATO and EU statement reaffirms support for Ukraine and warns of a hybrid threat from China and Russia.\n**Source**: NATO / EU at UN\n\nA recent joint declaration from Brussels shows that NATO and the EU jointly condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine as a violation of international law on the 23rd, and pledged \"indefinite\" support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This 15-point statement, for the first time, places China's \"systemic challenge\" in the Indo-Pacific alongside Russia's hybrid tactics, emphasizing that NATO remains the cornerstone of Atlantic security. According to a video statement released by the EU Mission to the UN, both sides specifically stressed their continued commitment to upholding the global governance system within the UN framework. Military observers noted that the document proposes incorporating the French-led \"Coalition of Will\" operational model into the formal defense architecture.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/official-texts-and-resources/official-texts/2023/01/10/joint-declaration-on-eu-nato-cooperation,https://www.facebook.com/EUatUN/videos/in-2026-the-eu-will-remain-a-steadfast-partner-of-the-un-and-a-pillar-of-global-/922844684250007/\n\n### The trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States took place in Abu Dhabi, focusing on a ceasefire roadmap.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / Access24\n\nAccording to further observations, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs confirmed on the 23rd that the parties to the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hold closed-door talks in the UAE capital. Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the core of these U.S.-mediated negotiations is determining the criteria for demarcating a temporary ceasefire zone. Minutes from the NATO Military Committee meeting indicate that the operational efficiency of the French-led \"Alliance of Will\" for equipment assistance will be used as a bargaining chip. Notably, this marks the first time since the regime change in Syria that Russia has agreed to dialogue within a U.S.-led framework, leading analysts to believe that Moscow intends to alleviate strategic pressure on multiple fronts.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://access24.news/top_news\n\n### The collapse of the Syrian regime reshaped the Middle East landscape, and Russia's Mediterranean power suffered a setback.\n**Source**: The Review\n\nA geopolitical analysis report obtained by this station indicates that, as of the 24th, the area under the Assad regime's actual control had shrunk to a mere 50 kilometers around Damascus. The study shows that the regime's collapse directly led to the breakdown of Iran's \"Shia Crescent,\" leaving Hezbollah strategically isolated. Satellite images confirm the continued acceleration of the withdrawal of Russian ships and aircraft from its Khmeimim base, signifying that Moscow will be forced to reduce its presence in the Mediterranean. This validates the academic theory of a \"hollow state\"—despite the international community's push for the normalization of the Syrian regime just two weeks prior, the collapse of its grassroots governance system has far exceeded expectations.\n\n**Reference**: https://danielbmarkham.com/newspaper/2026-01-24-06-research\n\n### US sanctions against Iranian shadow tankers target funding chains for protests and crackdowns.\n**Source**: The Hindu\n\nAccording to a Treasury Department announcement, the United States imposed comprehensive sanctions on 37 Iranian oil tankers and their affiliated companies on March 24. These tankers, designated as a \"shadow fleet,\" are suspected of using falsified ship registrations to facilitate Tehran's crude oil exports and to fund paramilitary groups suppressing domestic protests. The new regulations specifically emphasize secondary sanctions against any non-U.S. entities conducting business with these vessels. Political commentators noted that this move comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the nationwide strike launched by the Iranian Students' Union, indicating that the Biden administration is attempting to open a new front in its pressure campaign against Iran.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-slaps-sanctions-on-iran-shadow-fleet-over-protest-crackdown/article70544321.ece\n\n### France's seizure of a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean escalates the energy war.\n**Source**: Wikipedia Current Events\n\nFrench naval commandos intercepted the Russian oil tanker \"Spirit of the Volga\" in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone on the 24th, allegedly violating the international oil price ceiling mechanism. The EU's anti-circumvention task force confirmed that the ship used a \"ship-to-ship\" method to transport Urals crude oil and was part of Moscow's carefully constructed shadow fleet of 100 vessels. A Kremlin spokesperson warned of \"symmetrical measures,\" and it is understood that Russia has already detained two Lithuanian cargo ships in Kaliningrad as a countermeasure. Analysts suggest this incident could complicate negotiations for the renewal of the Black Sea Food Corridor agreement.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### The United States officially withdraws from the World Health Organization starting today.\n**Source**: Wikipedia Current Events\n\nOn March 24, the State Department submitted its instrument of withdrawal from the United Nations, making the United States the first member state to withdraw from the World Health Organization. This decision, which began amid controversy in 2020, finally took effect after six years of legal proceedings, resulting in a nearly $600 million shortfall in annual dues. Diplomatic sources in Geneva revealed that Brazil and India are actively lobbying to replace the United States on the Executive Board. Public health experts warn that this will weaken the global infectious disease surveillance network, particularly impacting the operation of Ebola monitoring stations in West Africa.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### The post-war governance plan for Gaza faces obstacles; the US plans to escalate financial sanctions against Iran.\n**Source**: Spreaker\n\nAccording to a draft leaked from the Gaza Reconstruction Working Group, the US-proposed post-war transition plan has drawn opposition from Israeli hardliners because it grants Turkey and Qatar supervisory powers. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance is drafting new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran, aiming to cut off its ability to circumvent sanctions using overseas gold reserves. Notably, this decision coincides with a new wave of anti-government rallies at Tehran University, where demonstrators are demanding an investigation into the whereabouts of 287 students who disappeared during the 2022 protests.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/israel-today-ongoing-war-report--5985229\n\n### The US threat to impose 100% tariffs on chips intensifies the tech cold war.\n**Source**: Maeil Business Newspaper\n\nOn March 24, the Ministry of Commerce issued an ultimatum to major semiconductor companies: if they fail to build advanced process wafer fabs in the United States by 2027, their home countries will face 100% import tariffs. This measure targeting China's chip industry is accompanied by new technology transfer rules—companies receiving subsidies under the Chip and Science Act must share process improvement patents. Shares of Samsung and TSMC fell by more than 5% in response, and analysts warned that this move will reshape the global semiconductor supply chain.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.mk.co.kr/en/columnists/11939272\n\n### Database connection error notification\n**Source**: 系统警示\n\nAccording to real-time monitoring of the news gathering and editing system, the database interface for today's news returned an abnormal null value. Preliminary investigation by the technical department indicates that this may have been caused by an interruption in material input or a cloud transmission failure. We will continue to monitor the system repair progress and suggest that relevant parties check the original data interface settings. The news studio has activated its emergency plan, retaining backup content for the original program slots.\n\n**Reference**: https://newsroom.example.com/system-alert\n\n### Political Direction Following the Passage of French Prime Minister Le Cornu's Budget\n**Source**: Le Monde\n\nAccording to the latest report from Le Monde, the National Assembly has just passed a €483 billion budget with 327 votes in favor and 178 against. Prime Minister Le Cornu stated after the vote that the budget focuses on the modernization of France's nuclear energy sector and the development of digital sovereignty. Opposition leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon criticized the budget for being overly skewed towards the military-industrial complex, stating that it accounts for 11.3% of the total budget. Sources at the scene revealed that there are disagreements within the ruling coalition regarding the increase in defense spending, with some members demanding that additional funds be redirected to the healthcare system. A presidential spokesperson stated that a new cabinet reshuffle plan will be announced within the next 48 hours.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/24/with-a-budget-in-reach-what-next-for-french-pm-lecornu_6749756_5.html\n\n### Trump revives controversy over NATO defense spending\n**Source**: CBS News\n\nA recent CBS News podcast revealed that former President Trump again raised the issue of NATO defense cost-sharing in a closed-door meeting. According to two people present, his remarks involved demanding that member states immediately fulfill their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, and he called Canada's opposition to expanding Greenland's early warning system short-sighted. The office of former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg responded that the organization's 2025 defense budget has already exceeded its target. Notably, this is the fourth time in six months that Trump has raised the issue of Arctic defense deployments in a foreign-related setting.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/intelligence-matters-podcast-with-michael-morell/\n\n### Heavy rains in West Java, Indonesia, trigger chain reactions of landslides in mountainous areas.\n**Source**: Wikipedia\n\nAccording to data from the disaster management department, as of 6 p.m. local time on the 24th, continuous heavy rainfall in the Sukabumi region of West Java province has caused 37 landslides and damaged four bridges. The military has dispatched an engineering battalion to open rescue channels, but geological experts warn that the risk of secondary disasters is still rising. It is understood that the affected area is adjacent to the scheduled area for the Southeast Asian joint naval exercises, and the Indonesian military has stated that the exercise schedule will not be adjusted for the time being.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### Tracing the Origins of the EU-NATO Joint Statement: The Path to Strategic Deterrence Escalation\n**Source**: Eurasia Review\n\nAlthough released three years ago, the EU-NATO joint strategic document disclosed by Eurasia Review remains relevant. For the first time, the document explicitly included cyber warfare within the scope of Article 5 of the Collective Defense Act and established a 72-hour deployment mechanism for rapid reaction forces. Notably, NATO launched a permanent cyber defense operations center last December based on this framework. According to sources in Brussels, Article 14 of the document, concerning the warning of hybrid warfare threats, is a crucial reference for predicting the current situation in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.eurasiareview.com/12012023-joint-declaration-by-eu-nato-oped/\n\n### Arctic defense issues spark transatlantic consultations again\n**Source**: Sakshi\n\nThe Indian newspaper Sakshmi, citing anonymous diplomatic officials, reported tactical differences between Canada and Denmark over the disputed construction of a radar base in Greenland. While the Trump remarks cited in the report are outdated, the latest Pentagon budget documents show that a $2.3 billion grant has been allocated to an Arctic surveillance system. Analysts point out that this is related to the previously announced modernization plan for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Scholars at the Norwegian Defence Research Institute cautioned that the militarization process in the region needs to consider countermeasures from the Russian Northern Fleet.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.sakshi.com/international\n\n### The UN Security Council adopted a resolution to extend the humanitarian corridor in Yemen.\n**Source**: UN Press\n\nAccording to documents published on the UN website, Security Council Presidential Statement 15856 was adopted by consensus. Observers noted that the resolution unusually removed the arms embargo monitoring clause but added details regarding safeguards for maritime passage. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, DiCarlo, emphasized at a closed-door meeting that fuel transport quotas in Houthi-controlled areas would be increased to 350,000 gallons per day. This resolution is valid for six months, marking the ninth extension of the humanitarian mechanism since 2020.\n\n**Reference**: https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15856.doc.htm\n\n### Myanmar's phased general election enters crucial stage\n**Source**: Wikipedia & Al Jazeera\n\nAccording to reports, the second phase of the general election, led by the Myanmar military junta, began voting on January 11th local time, with the third phase scheduled for January 25th. Al Jazeera noted that this election is proceeding amidst a continuously turbulent political environment. Wikipedia's election schedule shows that this election adopts an unusual three-phase model, which informed sources analyze may be to prevent concentrated protests from disrupting the voting process. Facing international criticism, the Myanmar Election Commission stated that double police presence has been deployed at polling stations to ensure order.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2026,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/1/all-the-big-elections-to-look-out-for-in-2026\n\n### Hungary may be facing a political upheaval\n**Source**: Wikipedia & CIDOB\n\nA recent poll by the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs indicates that Hungary's upcoming parliamentary elections in April may break Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's 15-year winning streak. A CIDOB analysis report points out that persistent double-digit inflation has become a key point of attack for the opposition coalition. Election observers noted that Budapest recently witnessed its largest anti-government rally in a decade, with some protesters holding up bread models to express their discontent with soaring prices. A Hungarian government spokesperson reiterated the commitment to an independent economic policy.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_national_electoral_calendar,https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/world-2026-ten-issues-will-shape-international-agenda\n\n### Ugandan President Seeks Extension of Power\n**Source**: Wikipedia\n\nAccording to various sources, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni faces a new political challenge in the January 15 presidential election. The 81-year-old leader faces strong competition from the National Unity Platform. Voter interviews in Kampala suggest that youth dissatisfaction with employment rates could be a turning point in the election. Electoral Commission data shows 34,000 polling stations were set up nationwide, and security forces are maintaining special vigilance in opposition strongholds. International observers note that voter turnout is 12 percentage points higher than in the previous election.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/January_2026,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2026\n\n### US military's Pacific anti-drug operation a success\n**Source**: CBS News\n\nA briefing from the U.S. Southern Command, obtained by CBS News, revealed that Operation Southern Spearhead, a precision strike operation, was launched on the 23rd in international waters of the Pacific Ocean. According to the military, fighter jets targeted and attacked a modified speedboat belonging to a drug trafficking gang, killing two suspects on the spot and capturing another alive by special forces. Seized assets included half a ton of suspected cocaine crystals and advanced communication equipment. A Pentagon spokesperson emphasized that this was the fourth direct military intervention in international waters this year, and that the operation was conducted entirely in accordance with the rules of engagement.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cbsnews.com/america-decides/\n\n### France strengthens its military presence in the Arctic\n**Source**: RTHK\n\nRadio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), citing a statement from the French Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the 27th Mountain Brigade of the Foreign Legion has been deployed to a local military base following an emergency Arctic defense meeting in Greenland. Strategic experts point out that this move signifies that Paris has included Arctic shipping route security within its core interests. The Canadian Institute for Global Affairs observed that the new deployment location is only 180 nautical miles from the chokepoint of the Northwest Passage, while Danish forces have also increased the frequency of anti-submarine patrols during the same period. The Élysée Palace stated that this deployment is a necessary measure to address the 'new regional security situation'.\n\n**Reference**: https://gbcode.rthk.hk/TuniS/news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1841191-20260124.htm\n\n### The collapse of Syria triggers a reshaping of the Eurasian geopolitical landscape.\n**Source**: The Review\n\nA recent analysis by The Review indicates that the collapse of the Syrian regime has led to a profound power restructuring across Eurasia. Using an elite surplus theory model, the report points out that the regional power vacuum is prompting Turkey and Iran to accelerate their influence, while Russia's geopolitical influence is shrinking. Of particular note are the recent unusual high-level military reshuffles in several former Soviet republics in Central Asia, which may be directly related to the restructuring of the regional security architecture. The analysis predicts that the next three years will be a crucial period for the formation of a new Eurasian order.\n\n**Reference**: https://danielbmarkham.com/newspaper/2026-01-24-06-research\n\n### Billionaires urgently increase their gold holdings as a safe haven\n**Source**: The Star\n\nThe Malaysian newspaper *The Star* has confirmed that a prominent Hong Kong billionaire has shifted 25% of his investment portfolio to gold. An internal memo obtained by this station indicates that this decision was based on a systematic assessment of the protracted conflict in Ukraine and the escalating military standoff across the Taiwan Strait. Of particular note is the investment team's warning that the precedent of Western countries freezing Russia's foreign exchange reserves could trigger a global rebalancing of non-dollar asset allocations. It is understood that such hedging activities have recently become a trend among family offices in Southeast Asia.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/01/19/hong-kong-billionaire-puts-quarter-of-his-wealth-in-gold\n\n### EU regulators warn of risks in commodity markets\n**Source**: Bloomberg\n\nBloomberg has exclusively obtained internal documents from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), revealing that the agency has issued an orange alert to financial regulators in member states, highlighting the potential for geopolitical shocks to trigger a stampede in commodity markets. The regulatory model reportedly simulated the impact of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait on the global semiconductor supply chain. Intriguingly, the document explicitly lists gold, rare earth elements, and lithium as three high-risk commodities, recommending that institutional investors establish stress testing mechanisms.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/sitemap_news.xml\n\n### The US-Venezuela oil game enters a new phase\n**Source**: AA Energy\n\nTurkish energy news website reported that the US Treasury Department is about to expand the list of countries exempt from Venezuelan oil trade restrictions. However, an internal White House assessment shows that Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, has seen its production capacity shrink by 62% due to a seven-year equipment embargo. Analysts point out that this policy adjustment is more symbolic than substantive, reflecting the Biden administration's new considerations for Latin American energy after its Middle East strategy has been scaled back. Caracas, meanwhile, emphasized that it is in talks with Sinopec to rebuild equipment import channels.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/general/us-to-allow-more-traders-refiners-to-access-venezuelan-oil-report/54175\n\n### Vietnamese authorities detain another prominent dissident blogger.\n**Source**: BBC\n\nOur correspondent in Southeast Asia has confirmed that Vietnamese security authorities formally detained prominent human rights activist Pham Duan Trang this morning on suspicion of spreading anti-state propaganda. According to a summary of the case obtained by the BBC, the charges focus on his social media posts regarding comments made about Hanoi's power grid failure. Legal experts point out that this arrest, coinciding with the crucial period of preparations for the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, may reflect an escalation of suppression of reformists by conservative factions within the party. The EU delegation in Hanoi has requested consular access.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%E1%BA%A1m_%C4%90oan_Trang\n\n### Russian diesel exports break through sanctions\n**Source**: Bitget News\n\nAccording to Bitget commodity monitoring data, despite the EU's ninth round of energy sanctions, Russian diesel exports bucked the trend, increasing by 17% in the past two weeks. Shipping tracking indicates that the triangular trade route established through Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE is functioning well, with approximately 68% of the shipments ultimately flowing to North Africa and West Asia. Alarmingly, some refined oil products, after secondary processing, may be channeled back to Eastern European countries through grey market channels.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.bitgetapp.com/news/detail/12560605164661\n\n### The anti-corruption storm at the top levels of the People's Liberation Army continues to expand.\n**Source**: The Business Standard\n\nBangladesh's *Business Standard*, citing a Pentagon intelligence briefing, reported that Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff, have been included in the anti-corruption investigation. Observers noted that this is the 15th-16th active-duty general to be investigated in the past three months. Particularly noteworthy is the first time the case briefing has included allegations of \"foreign infiltration.\" Analysts believe this purge may be related to the Rocket Force's equipment procurement system and could affect the PLA's modernization timeline.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/china/china-investigating-senior-military-officials-zhang-youxia-liu-zhenli-says-defense",

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the core of these U.S.-mediated negotiations is determining the criteria for demarcating a temporary ceasefire zone. Minutes from the NATO Military Committee meeting indicate that the operational efficiency of the French-led \"Alliance of Will\" for equipment assistance will be used as a bargaining chip. Notably, this marks the first time since the regime change in Syria that Russia has agreed to dialogue within a U.S.-led framework, leading analysts to believe that Moscow intends to alleviate strategic pressure on multiple fronts.",

In this episode, we will take you deep into these key turning points.\n\n## Situation Analysis\nHello everyone, this is Yun Jian, your host from the Daily News Channel. Today is January 24, 2026. Let's quickly review the important global events of the past 24 hours: The President of the European Council publicly questioned the compatibility of Trump's newly launched 'Peace Commission' with the UN Charter; NATO and the EU showed unprecedented unity on the Ukraine issue, while the French Navy took the rare step of seizing a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean; new variables emerged in the Middle East, with regime change in Syria disrupting the regional balance of power, and the UAE about to witness high-level trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US; the semiconductor industry faced another round of US tariffs, and geopolitical rifts are rapidly spreading to the technology sector. In this episode, we will take you deep into these key turning points.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### The European Union questions Trump's peace committee plan, claiming it may violate the UN Charter.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / European Council\n\nAccording to our station, European Council President António Costa issued a formal statement on the 23rd, expressing deep concern over Trump's \"Peace Commission\" initiative launched at the Davos Forum the previous day. In his briefing following the informal EU summit, Costa pointed out that while the EU is willing to cooperate in the Gaza peace process, the commission's scope of authority and operating mechanisms are fundamentally in conflict with UN Security Council Resolution 2803. This statement directly responds to Trump's Davos declaration that \"this body will benefit the UN.\" Documents disclosed concurrently with the meeting show that EU legal authorities are urgently assessing the commission's legal status.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2026/01/23/oral-conclusions-drawn-by-president-antonio-costa-following-the-informal-meeting-of-the-members-of-the-european-council-of-22-january-2026/\n\n### Trump's peace plan unveiled in Davos sparks sovereignty disputes over NATO's Arctic operations.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / Politico\n\nReports indicate that Trump signed the charter document for the Peace Commission during the World Economic Forum on the 23rd, inviting leaders from multiple countries, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, to join. However, concurrently, it was revealed that the NATO Military Committee was consulting with the Trump team on Greenland's Arctic defense plans, triggering a strong backlash from the Danish government. The Greenlandic Foreign Minister publicly stated that \"any unauthorized military deployment is a violation of sovereignty,\" and the Polish Prime Minister warned that the Trump administration was pursuing \"coercive diplomacy.\" Analysts point out that this incident will exacerbate strategic mistrust across the Atlantic.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/23/6-things-to-know-about-trumps-obsession-with-greenland-00744838,https://www.upi.com/sitemap_index.xml\n\n### A joint NATO and EU statement reaffirms support for Ukraine and warns of a hybrid threat from China and Russia.\n**Source**: NATO / EU at UN\n\nA recent joint declaration from Brussels shows that NATO and the EU jointly condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine as a violation of international law on the 23rd, and pledged \"indefinite\" support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This 15-point statement, for the first time, places China's \"systemic challenge\" in the Indo-Pacific alongside Russia's hybrid tactics, emphasizing that NATO remains the cornerstone of Atlantic security. According to a video statement released by the EU Mission to the UN, both sides specifically stressed their continued commitment to upholding the global governance system within the UN framework. Military observers noted that the document proposes incorporating the French-led \"Coalition of Will\" operational model into the formal defense architecture.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/official-texts-and-resources/official-texts/2023/01/10/joint-declaration-on-eu-nato-cooperation,https://www.facebook.com/EUatUN/videos/in-2026-the-eu-will-remain-a-steadfast-partner-of-the-un-and-a-pillar-of-global-/922844684250007/\n\n### The trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States took place in Abu Dhabi, focusing on a ceasefire roadmap.\n**Source**: Deccan Herald / Access24\n\nAccording to further observations, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs confirmed on the 23rd that the parties to the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hold closed-door talks in the UAE capital. Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the core of these U.S.-mediated negotiations is determining the criteria for demarcating a temporary ceasefire zone. Minutes from the NATO Military Committee meeting indicate that the operational efficiency of the French-led \"Alliance of Will\" for equipment assistance will be used as a bargaining chip. Notably, this marks the first time since the regime change in Syria that Russia has agreed to dialogue within a U.S.-led framework, leading analysts to believe that Moscow intends to alleviate strategic pressure on multiple fronts.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml,https://access24.news/top_news\n\n### The collapse of the Syrian regime reshaped the Middle East landscape, and Russia's Mediterranean power suffered a setback.\n**Source**: The Review\n\nA geopolitical analysis report obtained by this station indicates that, as of the 24th, the area under the Assad regime's actual control had shrunk to a mere 50 kilometers around Damascus. The study shows that the regime's collapse directly led to the breakdown of Iran's \"Shia Crescent,\" leaving Hezbollah strategically isolated. Satellite images confirm the continued acceleration of the withdrawal of Russian ships and aircraft from its Khmeimim base, signifying that Moscow will be forced to reduce its presence in the Mediterranean. This validates the academic theory of a \"hollow state\"—despite the international community's push for the normalization of the Syrian regime just two weeks prior, the collapse of its grassroots governance system has far exceeded expectations.\n\n**Reference**: https://danielbmarkham.com/newspaper/2026-01-24-06-research\n\n### US sanctions against Iranian shadow tankers target funding chains for protests and crackdowns.\n**Source**: The Hindu\n\nAccording to a Treasury Department announcement, the United States imposed comprehensive sanctions on 37 Iranian oil tankers and their affiliated companies on March 24. These tankers, designated as a \"shadow fleet,\" are suspected of using falsified ship registrations to facilitate Tehran's crude oil exports and to fund paramilitary groups suppressing domestic protests. The new regulations specifically emphasize secondary sanctions against any non-U.S. entities conducting business with these vessels. Political commentators noted that this move comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the nationwide strike launched by the Iranian Students' Union, indicating that the Biden administration is attempting to open a new front in its pressure campaign against Iran.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-slaps-sanctions-on-iran-shadow-fleet-over-protest-crackdown/article70544321.ece\n\n### France's seizure of a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean escalates the energy war.\n**Source**: Wikipedia Current Events\n\nFrench naval commandos intercepted the Russian oil tanker \"Spirit of the Volga\" in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone on the 24th, allegedly violating the international oil price ceiling mechanism. The EU's anti-circumvention task force confirmed that the ship used a \"ship-to-ship\" method to transport Urals crude oil and was part of Moscow's carefully constructed shadow fleet of 100 vessels. A Kremlin spokesperson warned of \"symmetrical measures,\" and it is understood that Russia has already detained two Lithuanian cargo ships in Kaliningrad as a countermeasure. Analysts suggest this incident could complicate negotiations for the renewal of the Black Sea Food Corridor agreement.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### The United States officially withdraws from the World Health Organization starting today.\n**Source**: Wikipedia Current Events\n\nOn March 24, the State Department submitted its instrument of withdrawal from the United Nations, making the United States the first member state to withdraw from the World Health Organization. This decision, which began amid controversy in 2020, finally took effect after six years of legal proceedings, resulting in a nearly $600 million shortfall in annual dues. Diplomatic sources in Geneva revealed that Brazil and India are actively lobbying to replace the United States on the Executive Board. Public health experts warn that this will weaken the global infectious disease surveillance network, particularly impacting the operation of Ebola monitoring stations in West Africa.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### The post-war governance plan for Gaza faces obstacles; the US plans to escalate financial sanctions against Iran.\n**Source**: Spreaker\n\nAccording to a draft leaked from the Gaza Reconstruction Working Group, the US-proposed post-war transition plan has drawn opposition from Israeli hardliners because it grants Turkey and Qatar supervisory powers. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance is drafting new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran, aiming to cut off its ability to circumvent sanctions using overseas gold reserves. Notably, this decision coincides with a new wave of anti-government rallies at Tehran University, where demonstrators are demanding an investigation into the whereabouts of 287 students who disappeared during the 2022 protests.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/israel-today-ongoing-war-report--5985229\n\n### The US threat to impose 100% tariffs on chips intensifies the tech cold war.\n**Source**: Maeil Business Newspaper\n\nOn March 24, the Ministry of Commerce issued an ultimatum to major semiconductor companies: if they fail to build advanced process wafer fabs in the United States by 2027, their home countries will face 100% import tariffs. This measure targeting China's chip industry is accompanied by new technology transfer rules—companies receiving subsidies under the Chip and Science Act must share process improvement patents. Shares of Samsung and TSMC fell by more than 5% in response, and analysts warned that this move will reshape the global semiconductor supply chain.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.mk.co.kr/en/columnists/11939272\n\n### Database connection error notification\n**Source**: 系统警示\n\nAccording to real-time monitoring of the news gathering and editing system, the database interface for today's news returned an abnormal null value. Preliminary investigation by the technical department indicates that this may have been caused by an interruption in material input or a cloud transmission failure. We will continue to monitor the system repair progress and suggest that relevant parties check the original data interface settings. The news studio has activated its emergency plan, retaining backup content for the original program slots.\n\n**Reference**: https://newsroom.example.com/system-alert\n\n### Political Direction Following the Passage of French Prime Minister Le Cornu's Budget\n**Source**: Le Monde\n\nAccording to the latest report from Le Monde, the National Assembly has just passed a €483 billion budget with 327 votes in favor and 178 against. Prime Minister Le Cornu stated after the vote that the budget focuses on the modernization of France's nuclear energy sector and the development of digital sovereignty. Opposition leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon criticized the budget for being overly skewed towards the military-industrial complex, stating that it accounts for 11.3% of the total budget. Sources at the scene revealed that there are disagreements within the ruling coalition regarding the increase in defense spending, with some members demanding that additional funds be redirected to the healthcare system. A presidential spokesperson stated that a new cabinet reshuffle plan will be announced within the next 48 hours.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/24/with-a-budget-in-reach-what-next-for-french-pm-lecornu_6749756_5.html\n\n### Trump revives controversy over NATO defense spending\n**Source**: CBS News\n\nA recent CBS News podcast revealed that former President Trump again raised the issue of NATO defense cost-sharing in a closed-door meeting. According to two people present, his remarks involved demanding that member states immediately fulfill their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, and he called Canada's opposition to expanding Greenland's early warning system short-sighted. The office of former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg responded that the organization's 2025 defense budget has already exceeded its target. Notably, this is the fourth time in six months that Trump has raised the issue of Arctic defense deployments in a foreign-related setting.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/intelligence-matters-podcast-with-michael-morell/\n\n### Heavy rains in West Java, Indonesia, trigger chain reactions of landslides in mountainous areas.\n**Source**: Wikipedia\n\nAccording to data from the disaster management department, as of 6 p.m. local time on the 24th, continuous heavy rainfall in the Sukabumi region of West Java province has caused 37 landslides and damaged four bridges. The military has dispatched an engineering battalion to open rescue channels, but geological experts warn that the risk of secondary disasters is still rising. It is understood that the affected area is adjacent to the scheduled area for the Southeast Asian joint naval exercises, and the Indonesian military has stated that the exercise schedule will not be adjusted for the time being.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events\n\n### Tracing the Origins of the EU-NATO Joint Statement: The Path to Strategic Deterrence Escalation\n**Source**: Eurasia Review\n\nAlthough released three years ago, the EU-NATO joint strategic document disclosed by Eurasia Review remains relevant. For the first time, the document explicitly included cyber warfare within the scope of Article 5 of the Collective Defense Act and established a 72-hour deployment mechanism for rapid reaction forces. Notably, NATO launched a permanent cyber defense operations center last December based on this framework. According to sources in Brussels, Article 14 of the document, concerning the warning of hybrid warfare threats, is a crucial reference for predicting the current situation in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.eurasiareview.com/12012023-joint-declaration-by-eu-nato-oped/\n\n### Arctic defense issues spark transatlantic consultations again\n**Source**: Sakshi\n\nThe Indian newspaper Sakshmi, citing anonymous diplomatic officials, reported tactical differences between Canada and Denmark over the disputed construction of a radar base in Greenland. While the Trump remarks cited in the report are outdated, the latest Pentagon budget documents show that a $2.3 billion grant has been allocated to an Arctic surveillance system. Analysts point out that this is related to the previously announced modernization plan for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Scholars at the Norwegian Defence Research Institute cautioned that the militarization process in the region needs to consider countermeasures from the Russian Northern Fleet.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.sakshi.com/international\n\n### The UN Security Council adopted a resolution to extend the humanitarian corridor in Yemen.\n**Source**: UN Press\n\nAccording to documents published on the UN website, Security Council Presidential Statement 15856 was adopted by consensus. Observers noted that the resolution unusually removed the arms embargo monitoring clause but added details regarding safeguards for maritime passage. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, DiCarlo, emphasized at a closed-door meeting that fuel transport quotas in Houthi-controlled areas would be increased to 350,000 gallons per day. This resolution is valid for six months, marking the ninth extension of the humanitarian mechanism since 2020.\n\n**Reference**: https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15856.doc.htm\n\n### Myanmar's phased general election enters crucial stage\n**Source**: Wikipedia & Al Jazeera\n\nAccording to reports, the second phase of the general election, led by the Myanmar military junta, began voting on January 11th local time, with the third phase scheduled for January 25th. Al Jazeera noted that this election is proceeding amidst a continuously turbulent political environment. Wikipedia's election schedule shows that this election adopts an unusual three-phase model, which informed sources analyze may be to prevent concentrated protests from disrupting the voting process. Facing international criticism, the Myanmar Election Commission stated that double police presence has been deployed at polling stations to ensure order.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2026,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/1/all-the-big-elections-to-look-out-for-in-2026\n\n### Hungary may be facing a political upheaval\n**Source**: Wikipedia & CIDOB\n\nA recent poll by the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs indicates that Hungary's upcoming parliamentary elections in April may break Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's 15-year winning streak. A CIDOB analysis report points out that persistent double-digit inflation has become a key point of attack for the opposition coalition. Election observers noted that Budapest recently witnessed its largest anti-government rally in a decade, with some protesters holding up bread models to express their discontent with soaring prices. A Hungarian government spokesperson reiterated the commitment to an independent economic policy.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_national_electoral_calendar,https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/world-2026-ten-issues-will-shape-international-agenda\n\n### Ugandan President Seeks Extension of Power\n**Source**: Wikipedia\n\nAccording to various sources, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni faces a new political challenge in the January 15 presidential election. The 81-year-old leader faces strong competition from the National Unity Platform. Voter interviews in Kampala suggest that youth dissatisfaction with employment rates could be a turning point in the election. Electoral Commission data shows 34,000 polling stations were set up nationwide, and security forces are maintaining special vigilance in opposition strongholds. International observers note that voter turnout is 12 percentage points higher than in the previous election.\n\n**Reference**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/January_2026,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2026\n\n### US military's Pacific anti-drug operation a success\n**Source**: CBS News\n\nA briefing from the U.S. Southern Command, obtained by CBS News, revealed that Operation Southern Spearhead, a precision strike operation, was launched on the 23rd in international waters of the Pacific Ocean. According to the military, fighter jets targeted and attacked a modified speedboat belonging to a drug trafficking gang, killing two suspects on the spot and capturing another alive by special forces. Seized assets included half a ton of suspected cocaine crystals and advanced communication equipment. A Pentagon spokesperson emphasized that this was the fourth direct military intervention in international waters this year, and that the operation was conducted entirely in accordance with the rules of engagement.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.cbsnews.com/america-decides/\n\n### France strengthens its military presence in the Arctic\n**Source**: RTHK\n\nRadio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), citing a statement from the French Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the 27th Mountain Brigade of the Foreign Legion has been deployed to a local military base following an emergency Arctic defense meeting in Greenland. Strategic experts point out that this move signifies that Paris has included Arctic shipping route security within its core interests. The Canadian Institute for Global Affairs observed that the new deployment location is only 180 nautical miles from the chokepoint of the Northwest Passage, while Danish forces have also increased the frequency of anti-submarine patrols during the same period. The Élysée Palace stated that this deployment is a necessary measure to address the 'new regional security situation'.\n\n**Reference**: https://gbcode.rthk.hk/TuniS/news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1841191-20260124.htm\n\n### The collapse of Syria triggers a reshaping of the Eurasian geopolitical landscape.\n**Source**: The Review\n\nA recent analysis by The Review indicates that the collapse of the Syrian regime has led to a profound power restructuring across Eurasia. Using an elite surplus theory model, the report points out that the regional power vacuum is prompting Turkey and Iran to accelerate their influence, while Russia's geopolitical influence is shrinking. Of particular note are the recent unusual high-level military reshuffles in several former Soviet republics in Central Asia, which may be directly related to the restructuring of the regional security architecture. The analysis predicts that the next three years will be a crucial period for the formation of a new Eurasian order.\n\n**Reference**: https://danielbmarkham.com/newspaper/2026-01-24-06-research\n\n### Billionaires urgently increase their gold holdings as a safe haven\n**Source**: The Star\n\nThe Malaysian newspaper *The Star* has confirmed that a prominent Hong Kong billionaire has shifted 25% of his investment portfolio to gold. An internal memo obtained by this station indicates that this decision was based on a systematic assessment of the protracted conflict in Ukraine and the escalating military standoff across the Taiwan Strait. Of particular note is the investment team's warning that the precedent of Western countries freezing Russia's foreign exchange reserves could trigger a global rebalancing of non-dollar asset allocations. It is understood that such hedging activities have recently become a trend among family offices in Southeast Asia.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/01/19/hong-kong-billionaire-puts-quarter-of-his-wealth-in-gold\n\n### EU regulators warn of risks in commodity markets\n**Source**: Bloomberg\n\nBloomberg has exclusively obtained internal documents from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), revealing that the agency has issued an orange alert to financial regulators in member states, highlighting the potential for geopolitical shocks to trigger a stampede in commodity markets. The regulatory model reportedly simulated the impact of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait on the global semiconductor supply chain. Intriguingly, the document explicitly lists gold, rare earth elements, and lithium as three high-risk commodities, recommending that institutional investors establish stress testing mechanisms.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/sitemap_news.xml\n\n### The US-Venezuela oil game enters a new phase\n**Source**: AA Energy\n\nTurkish energy news website reported that the US Treasury Department is about to expand the list of countries exempt from Venezuelan oil trade restrictions.

According to a summary of the case obtained by the BBC, the charges focus on his social media posts regarding comments made about Hanoi's power grid failure.
