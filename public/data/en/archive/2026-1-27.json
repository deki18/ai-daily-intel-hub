Let's delve into the pulse behind these major news stories one by one.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### More than 165 Russian drones attacked Odessa and other locations in Ukraine; Zelensky called for international pressure.\n**Source**: UNN / The Independent\n\nAccording to UNN and The Independent, on January 27, 2026, Russia launched over 165 attack drones in a fierce assault on Odessa, Kherson, and Lviv, Ukraine. Odessa was hit by more than 50 drones, damaging energy and civilian targets, severely injuring five residential buildings and a church, and injuring dozens of people, including children. Shelling in the Kherson region caused buildings to catch fire, and infrastructure in Lviv was also affected. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned such actions as undermining the diplomatic process and called on the United States and European partners not to remain silent, but to pressure Moscow through sanctions and a blockade of the Russian oil tanker fleet. DTEK confirmed that Odessa's energy facilities were severely damaged, and repairs would be time-consuming. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev stated that Ukraine's withdrawal from Donbas is a key path to peace. This attack exacerbated the civilian plight and tested upcoming diplomatic negotiations.\n\n**Reference**: https://unn.ua/en/news/every-such-russian-strike-undermines-diplomacy-zelenskyy-expects-america-and-other-partners-not-to-remain-silent-after-a-new-russian-attack;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-live-putin-zelensky-trump-eu-nato-b2908185.html\n\n### Russian Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov inspected troops in eastern Ukraine, claiming that they had seized over 500 square kilometers of land in January.\n**Source**: Al Arabiya\n\nAccording to a report from Al Arabiya, on January 27, 2026, Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, inspected troops of the Western Forces in eastern Ukraine to assess the progress of their operations. He declared that Russian forces had seized over 500 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in January and would continue their offensive along the entire front. This visit followed the trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, with the next round of negotiations expected on February 1. Gerasimov's trip highlights Moscow's focus on the front lines and reflects the continuously evolving battlefield situation, despite the dual pressures of the energy crisis and cold weather facing Ukraine. This could potentially influence upcoming diplomatic efforts.\n\n**Reference**: https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2026/01/27/russian-takes-more-than-500-square-km-of-ukraine-in-january-russia-s-top-general-says\n\n### The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has been deployed to the Middle East to address tensions with Iran.\n**Source**: Gulf News\n\nAccording to Gulf News, on January 26, 2026, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), accompanied by the destroyers USS Spruance, USS Michael Murphy, and USS Frank E. Peterson Jr., entered Middle Eastern waters under the command of the U.S. Fifth Fleet Central Command. The deployment aims to enhance firepower and support defense or potential operations against Iran; the carrier has previously targeted the Houthi rebels and Iran. This move stems from escalating regional tensions and tensions with Iran, with Trump administration officials stating they would strengthen naval dominance despite protests and warnings. The carrier's arrival in the Arabian Sea further underscores the U.S. military's strategic presence in the Middle East.\n\n**Reference**: https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/uss-abraham-lincoln-aircraft-carrier-in-the-middle-east-what-you-need-to-know-1.500421868\n\n### China is investigating high-ranking officials, including Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, for allegedly leaking nuclear secrets and engaging in corruption.\n**Source**: FDD Overnight Brief, Atalayar, Bloomberg\n\nData from FDD Overnight Brief, Atalayar, and Bloomberg shows that from January 24 to 26, 2026, China's Ministry of National Defense announced investigations into Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff Department, on charges including serious disciplinary violations, leaking nuclear secrets to the United States, corruption, and challenging Xi Jinping's authority. Zhang Youxia is a close confidant of Xi and an official in the nuclear program; this move deepens Xi's purge, leaving only Xi and himself in the Central Military Commission. Analysts say this leads to instability within the People's Liberation Army, reduced combat readiness, and increased risks in the Taiwan direction, which Taipei describes as unusual. The incident exposes a power struggle at the highest levels.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.fdd.org/overnight-brief/january-26-2026/,https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/gustavo-aristegui/geopolitical-report-january-26-2026/20260126202508222824.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-27/xi-s-military-purges-raise-questions-over-china-s-pla-readiness\n\n### The US releases its 2026 defense strategy, prioritizing homeland deterrence against China and providing limited assistance to allies.\n**Source**: CSIS, GMFUS, Taiwan Plus\n\nAn analysis by CSIS, GMFUS, and Taiwan Plus indicates that the Trump administration's National Defense Strategy (renamed the War Department after the Department of Defense) to be released on January 23, 2026, will shift its focus to prioritizing homeland and border security, followed by China, seeking stable diplomacy rather than confrontation, deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing allies sharing the burden in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and making no mention of Taiwan. Unlike previous strategies that viewed China as the primary threat, the focus now shifts to the Western Hemisphere and the industrial base. This move may promote US-China stability, but allies are concerned about reduced support.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-trump-administrations-new-national-defense-strategy-say-about-china,https://www.gmfus.org/news/us-national-defense-strategy,https://www.taiwanplus.com/news/taiwan-talks/international-analysis/260127017/china-purges-general-why-new-us-defense-strategy-isnt-downplaying-china,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGv_QKS-CWA\n\n### NATO Secretary General Rutte warned Europe that it would be unable to defend itself without the US, and France retaliated.\n**Source**: Associated Press via KOSU\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report via KOSU, on January 27, 2026, in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told EU lawmakers that Europe cannot defend itself without US military assistance, including a nuclear umbrella, and that defense spending needs to double to 10% of GDP. This comes amid calls for increased military spending due to Trump's Greenland threat and France's calls for strategic autonomy. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot countered that Europeans must be responsible for being the European pillar of NATO.

This highlights the transatlantic divide.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.kosu.org/news/2026-01-27/nato-chief-wishes-good-luck-to-those-who-think-europe-can-defend-itself-without-us-help\n\n### The Philippine military has confirmed that a Philippine citizen was a Russian mercenary who died in Ukraine.\n**Source**: Philstar\n\nAccording to Philstar, on January 27, 2026, the Philippine military confirmed a Ukrainian report that a Filipino national had been killed while fighting as a Russian mercenary in Ukraine.

      "summary": "Data from FDD Overnight Brief, Atalayar, and Bloomberg shows that from January 24 to 26, 2026, China's Ministry of National Defense announced investigations into Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff Department, on charges including serious disciplinary violations, leaking nuclear secrets to the United States, corruption, and challenging Xi Jinping's authority. Zhang Youxia is a close confidant of Xi and an official in the nuclear program; this move deepens Xi's purge, leaving only Xi and himself in the Central Military Commission. Analysts say this leads to instability within the People's Liberation Army, reduced combat readiness, and increased risks in the Taiwan direction, which Taipei describes as unusual. The incident exposes a power struggle at the highest levels.",

Let's delve into the pulse behind these major news stories one by one.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n\n### More than 165 Russian drones attacked Odessa and other locations in Ukraine; Zelensky called for international pressure.\n**Source**: UNN / The Independent\n\nAccording to UNN and The Independent, on January 27, 2026, Russia launched over 165 attack drones in a fierce assault on Odessa, Kherson, and Lviv, Ukraine. Odessa was hit by more than 50 drones, damaging energy and civilian targets, severely injuring five residential buildings and a church, and injuring dozens of people, including children. Shelling in the Kherson region caused buildings to catch fire, and infrastructure in Lviv was also affected. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned such actions as undermining the diplomatic process and called on the United States and European partners not to remain silent, but to pressure Moscow through sanctions and a blockade of the Russian oil tanker fleet. DTEK confirmed that Odessa's energy facilities were severely damaged, and repairs would be time-consuming. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev stated that Ukraine's withdrawal from Donbas is a key path to peace. This attack exacerbated the civilian plight and tested upcoming diplomatic negotiations.\n\n**Reference**: https://unn.ua/en/news/every-such-russian-strike-undermines-diplomacy-zelenskyy-expects-america-and-other-partners-not-to-remain-silent-after-a-new-russian-attack;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-live-putin-zelensky-trump-eu-nato-b2908185.html\n\n### Russian Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov inspected troops in eastern Ukraine, claiming that they had seized over 500 square kilometers of land in January.\n**Source**: Al Arabiya\n\nAccording to a report from Al Arabiya, on January 27, 2026, Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, inspected troops of the Western Forces in eastern Ukraine to assess the progress of their operations. He declared that Russian forces had seized over 500 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in January and would continue their offensive along the entire front. This visit followed the trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, with the next round of negotiations expected on February 1. Gerasimov's trip highlights Moscow's focus on the front lines and reflects the continuously evolving battlefield situation, despite the dual pressures of the energy crisis and cold weather facing Ukraine. This could potentially influence upcoming diplomatic efforts.\n\n**Reference**: https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2026/01/27/russian-takes-more-than-500-square-km-of-ukraine-in-january-russia-s-top-general-says\n\n### The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has been deployed to the Middle East to address tensions with Iran.\n**Source**: Gulf News\n\nAccording to Gulf News, on January 26, 2026, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), accompanied by the destroyers USS Spruance, USS Michael Murphy, and USS Frank E. Peterson Jr., entered Middle Eastern waters under the command of the U.S. Fifth Fleet Central Command. The deployment aims to enhance firepower and support defense or potential operations against Iran; the carrier has previously targeted the Houthi rebels and Iran. This move stems from escalating regional tensions and tensions with Iran, with Trump administration officials stating they would strengthen naval dominance despite protests and warnings. The carrier's arrival in the Arabian Sea further underscores the U.S. military's strategic presence in the Middle East.\n\n**Reference**: https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/uss-abraham-lincoln-aircraft-carrier-in-the-middle-east-what-you-need-to-know-1.500421868\n\n### China is investigating high-ranking officials, including Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, for allegedly leaking nuclear secrets and engaging in corruption.\n**Source**: FDD Overnight Brief, Atalayar, Bloomberg\n\nData from FDD Overnight Brief, Atalayar, and Bloomberg shows that from January 24 to 26, 2026, China's Ministry of National Defense announced investigations into Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, Chief of the Joint Staff Department, on charges including serious disciplinary violations, leaking nuclear secrets to the United States, corruption, and challenging Xi Jinping's authority. Zhang Youxia is a close confidant of Xi and an official in the nuclear program; this move deepens Xi's purge, leaving only Xi and himself in the Central Military Commission. Analysts say this leads to instability within the People's Liberation Army, reduced combat readiness, and increased risks in the Taiwan direction, which Taipei describes as unusual. The incident exposes a power struggle at the highest levels.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.fdd.org/overnight-brief/january-26-2026/,https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/gustavo-aristegui/geopolitical-report-january-26-2026/20260126202508222824.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-27/xi-s-military-purges-raise-questions-over-china-s-pla-readiness\n\n### The US releases its 2026 defense strategy, prioritizing homeland deterrence against China and providing limited assistance to allies.\n**Source**: CSIS, GMFUS, Taiwan Plus\n\nAn analysis by CSIS, GMFUS, and Taiwan Plus indicates that the Trump administration's National Defense Strategy (renamed the War Department after the Department of Defense) to be released on January 23, 2026, will shift its focus to prioritizing homeland and border security, followed by China, seeking stable diplomacy rather than confrontation, deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing allies sharing the burden in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and making no mention of Taiwan. Unlike previous strategies that viewed China as the primary threat, the focus now shifts to the Western Hemisphere and the industrial base. This move may promote US-China stability, but allies are concerned about reduced support.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-trump-administrations-new-national-defense-strategy-say-about-china,https://www.gmfus.org/news/us-national-defense-strategy,https://www.taiwanplus.com/news/taiwan-talks/international-analysis/260127017/china-purges-general-why-new-us-defense-strategy-isnt-downplaying-china,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGv_QKS-CWA\n\n### NATO Secretary General Rutte warned Europe that it would be unable to defend itself without the US, and France retaliated.\n**Source**: Associated Press via KOSU\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report via KOSU, on January 27, 2026, in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told EU lawmakers that Europe cannot defend itself without US military assistance, including a nuclear umbrella, and that defense spending needs to double to 10% of GDP. This comes amid calls for increased military spending due to Trump's Greenland threat and France's calls for strategic autonomy. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot countered that Europeans must be responsible for being the European pillar of NATO. Rutte praised Trump's push for increased spending but rejected the idea of an EU military. This highlights the transatlantic divide.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.kosu.org/news/2026-01-27/nato-chief-wishes-good-luck-to-those-who-think-europe-can-defend-itself-without-us-help\n\n### The Philippine military has confirmed that a Philippine citizen was a Russian mercenary who died in Ukraine.\n**Source**: Philstar\n\nAccording to Philstar, on January 27, 2026, the Philippine military confirmed a Ukrainian report that a Filipino national had been killed while fighting as a Russian mercenary in Ukraine. The Russo-Ukrainian war has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of displacements, with Russia recruiting thousands of foreign nationals to fight. This incident serves as a reminder of the global issue of mercenaries.\n\n**Reference**: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2026/01/27/2503836/military-verifying-ukraine-report-filipino-killed-fighting-russia\n\n### Hamas seeks police role in Gaza, former disarmament negotiator\n**Source**: Al Arabiya\n\nAccording to Al Arabiya, on January 27, 2026, Hamas, having controlled less than half of Gaza following the Trump-brokered October ceasefire, sought to have its police play a role in upcoming disarmament negotiations.
