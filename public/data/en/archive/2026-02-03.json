Today is February 3, 2026. In the coming hours, I will provide an in-depth analysis of the major military and geopolitical developments that have occurred globally over the past 24 hours. The core keyword for this episode is 'transformation'. First, we must focus on the impending expiration of the New START Treaty, the last line of defense in the US-Russia nuclear arms race, leaving the world facing an unprecedented risk of a nuclear regulatory vacuum. Meanwhile, the Middle East is witnessing a peculiar coexistence of 'maximum pressure' and 'diplomatic engagement': the Trump administration, while deploying a carrier strike group to deter Iran, has also confirmed serious dialogue between the two sides. In Europe, with NATO exercises conducted 'without US participation,' rifts among allies are widening further due to the Greenland policy and defense autonomy issues. Furthermore, defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region is being rapidly restructured, from the resumption of search and rescue exercises between South Korea and Japan to military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, indicating a significant escalation in geopolitical competition. Please see the detailed reports below.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. The End of the Era of Nuclear Constraints? Two Days to Go Before the New START Treaty Between the US and Russia\n- **Time**: 2026-02-03\n- **Source**: Malay Mail, Newsgram\n- **Summary**: According to our station, the only remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), is scheduled to expire on February 5, 2026. The two sides have yet to reach a renewal or replacement agreement, raising strong concerns among global defense experts about a potential \"vacuum\" in nuclear force oversight. Reports indicate that once the treaty expires, bilateral on-site verification and data exchange mechanisms will completely cease. Analysis suggests that the US has the capability to increase its deployed nuclear warheads by 110% within months, while Russia could increase them by as much as 60%. This not only signifies a loss of transparency but could also trigger an uncontrollable global arms race in the absence of a dispute resolution mechanism.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Malay Mail](https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2026/02/03/what-the-new-start-nuclear-treaty-is-and-why-its-expiry-could-reshape-global-nuclear-limits/207705)\n  - [2] [Newsgram](https://www.newsgram.com/america/2026/02/03/us-russia-nuclear-treaty-expires)\n\n### 2. Frequent diplomatic signals from the US and Iran have been exchanged, with Trump confirming that the two sides are engaged in \"serious dialogue.\"\n- **Time**: 2026-02-03\n- **Source**: CGTN, 路透社\n- **Summary**: According to CGTN and several international media outlets, US President Trump recently confirmed that the US and Iran are engaged in \"serious dialogue\" regarding a new security agreement, marking the first direct diplomatic contact since April 2026. Iranian senior official Larijani also stated that negotiations are progressing actively. Trump explicitly demanded that any new agreement must include Iran halting its production of highly enriched uranium and strictly curbing its ballistic missile program. Despite this diplomatic glimmer of hope, the uncertainty surrounding the deal has caused WTI crude oil prices to fluctuate, briefly falling below $62 per barrel. The market is closely watching whether the negotiations can lead to a long-term de-escalation of geopolitical tensions.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CGTN](https://www.cgtn.com/world/middle-east.html)\n  - [2] [路透社](https://www.rttnews.com/3613901/crude-oil-skyrockets-amid-imminent-war-threat-in-middle-east.aspx?type=cdt)\n\n### 3.

According to the Deccan Herald, the US has deployed a large carrier fleet centered on the USS Abraham Lincoln, along with several destroyers and elite fighter jets, to the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters. Analysts point out that this \"carrot and stick\" strategy aims to increase the US's leverage at the negotiating table through maximum military pressure. Currently, the US military is on high alert in the region, designed to respond to any possible contingencies and ensure that its proposed security agreement demands are taken seriously by Iran.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n  - [2] [Madhyamam Online](https://madhyamamonline.com/amp/world/iran-ready-fair-and-equitable-talks-us-says-president-1491785)\n\n### 4.

Reports indicate that this move aims to completely isolate Iran economically and cut off its access to foreign exchange. Currently, global supply chains have begun to react, with companies in many countries urgently assessing trade risks related to Iran. This strategy, combined with the current US military deterrence, forms the two pillars of the Trump administration's Iran policy, intended to force Tehran to make substantial concessions in nuclear agreement negotiations through extreme economic pressure.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/)\n  - [2] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil/news/522351)\n\n### 5.
