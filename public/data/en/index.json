    "summary": "According to the latest news received by this station, the US federal government officially entered a partial shutdown in the early hours of January 31st local time because Congress failed to pass several key spending bills before Friday's midnight deadline. Bloomberg reported that although the Senate had previously passed the bills by a large majority, they failed to be enacted due to the early departure of House members from Washington. President Trump had previously warned that the shutdown would limit the functions of several government agencies. Currently, the White House is urging lawmakers to return on Monday and reconsider the bills to minimize their impact on the operation of the country. This deadlock reflects the serious domestic political challenges Trump faces during his term.",
