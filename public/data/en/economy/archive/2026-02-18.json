It's a pleasure to bring you the latest global developments during this in-depth time. In the past 24 hours, global financial markets and the geopolitical stage have been in turmoil, with policy maneuvering and economic data weaving together a complex tapestry. From the heated debate within the Federal Reserve regarding the path of interest rate cuts to the multi-billion dollar strategic investment agreement reached between the US and Japan; from the European Central Bank's wait-and-see attitude amidst cooling inflation to the deep fiscal concerns triggered by the continued US government shutdown, every decision is reshaping the global economic landscape. In this episode, we will analyze 20 major events that have impacted global processes in the past 24 hours, guiding you through the fog of geopolitics to grasp the core market trends.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. Federal Reserve officials are divided: the window for rate cuts remains highly uncertain.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, Morningstar, U.S. News\n- **Summary**: According to our station, at this crucial moment before the release of the Federal Reserve's January meeting minutes, a clear \"hawkish-dove confrontation\" is emerging among officials regarding monetary policy. Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr stated clearly on Tuesday that interest rates should remain high for some time until inflation consistently and steadily moves towards the 2% target, reflecting the Fed's internal vigilance regarding sticky inflation. However, Chicago Fed President Goolsby released a relatively dovish signal. In an interview, he pointed out that several rate cuts this year are possible if the labor market continues to cool and inflation gets on track. Currently, the market is paying close attention to Wednesday's meeting minutes with high caution, and the dollar index has risen above 97.22, boosted by this expectation.

U.S. industrial output recorded solid growth, but core inflationary pressures remain.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: CFI Trade, Cleveland Fed\n- **Summary**: According to the latest macroeconomic data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and related institutions, the US real economy has shown strong resilience. Our observation shows that the latest US industrial output growth rate was 1.99%, indicating stability in manufacturing and production. However, regarding inflation data, the Cleveland Fed's immediate forecast indicates that the PCE inflation rate in the first quarter of 2026 is expected to be between 1.92% and 2.13%, while the core PCE inflation rate remains high at 2.43%. This means that although overall inflation has slowed, core inflation pressure excluding energy and food should not be underestimated. Currently, although the US government has been shut down for more than 43 days, causing delays in the release of some government data, the mainstream market view is that the US economy is on the verge of a \"soft landing,\" that is, achieving price control without triggering a recession. This leaves extremely limited room for future policy adjustments.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CFI Trade](https://cfi.trade/en/blog/economic/markets-watching-us-feds-minutes-meeting-on-february-2026-inflation-economic-growth)\n  - [2] [Cleveland Fed](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting)\n\n### 3. Fitch warned of the risks to US government debt, with the partial shutdown exacerbating fiscal deficit pressures.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Fitch Ratings, RSM, St. Louis Fed\n- **Summary**: Reports indicate that Fitch Ratings recently issued a stern warning, pointing out that the continued partial government shutdown, caused by the failure of US lawmakers to reach an agreement on financing the Department of Homeland Security, once again highlights the negative impact of political polarization on fiscal policy. Fitch predicts that by 2027, US general government debt will surge to over 120% of GDP, a ratio far higher than any other AA-rated sovereign nation. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that the current repurchase market is approaching $14 trillion, demonstrating the government's high dependence on financing from financial institutions. In the current high-inflation environment, the growth of nominal debt has become a key indicator of the health of US public finances. Analysts believe that with continuously rising financing costs, this deficit spending model is facing severe sustainability challenges, and the accumulation of sovereign risk may trigger deeper market turmoil in the future.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/us-govt-shutdown-underscores-polarization-amid-high-fiscal-deficits-17-02-2026)\n  - [2] [RSM](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/market-minute-growth-of-u-s-government-debt-and-the-repo-market/)\n\n### 4. The Federal Reserve assesses the resilience of the banking system and monitors capital levels under funding pressures.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Federal Reserve Board\n- **Summary**: A recent technical research report released by the Federal Reserve Board shows that the Fed is using sophisticated models to assess the stability of the U.S. banking system in the face of funding shocks on the liability side. The report, titled \"Assessing Bank Resilience to Funding Shocks,\" aims to simulate changes in banks' capital levels in the face of large-scale deposit outflows or soaring funding costs. According to the report obtained by this station, the Fed conducted stress tests over nine quarters, focusing on assessing the distribution of the MACT E1 capital ratio. The study indicates that banks' sensitivity to the 3-month Treasury yield premium has become a key mechanical indicator of their resilience. This research was released against the backdrop of increased global liquidity volatility, aiming to provide theoretical support for financial regulation and ensure that the U.S. banking system can maintain the stability of its core capital in the face of monetary tightening and potential market shocks.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/assessing-bank-resilience-to-a-funding-shock-20260217.html)\n\n### 5. Affected by the adjustment of the real estate market, China's home decoration industry is facing a survival challenge.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: South China Morning Post\n- **Summary**: According to a special report by the South China Morning Post, the Chinese home decoration and furniture industry is facing an unprecedentedly severe situation due to the continued decline in domestic housing prices and increasingly fierce price competition within the industry. With weakening demand for new homes, many small decoration and furnishing companies are forced into a difficult \"survival battle.\" Industry observers point out that as the Chinese real estate market enters a long-term structural adjustment phase, the profit margins of related downstream industries are being severely squeezed. This is not only a micro-level manifestation against the backdrop of a sluggish real estate market, but also reflects the profound growing pains experienced by related real industries during economic transformation. Many companies are attempting to find a way out through overseas expansion or transformation, but the overall downward pressure on the industry remains enormous in the short term.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/live)\n\n### 6. Global competition in key mineral markets intensifies: Trade policy becomes the biggest variable in the industry.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: MarketScreener\n- **Summary**: At the Global Key Minerals Update Conference held on February 18, 2026, analysts expressed caution regarding the current mining market outlook. According to this station, despite increasing policy support for the clean energy transition in North America and Europe, fluctuating trade policies between Western economies and China remain the most unpredictable factor affecting the market for core battery materials such as high-purity nickel. Particularly in the nickel ore market, the supply side is differentiating pricing based on the carbon intensity of the producing region. For example, the Aurora nickel sulfide deposit in Canada is attracting attention due to its low-carbon advantages and well-developed infrastructure; the project's resources are said to be sufficient to supply batteries for over 700,000 electric vehicles. Industry executives emphasized that identifying market signals amidst complex geopolitical \"noise\" has become a key challenge in controlling jurisdictional risks in current mining investments.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/clean-energy-transition-transcript-from-the-february-18-2026-critical-minerals-update-2026-02-18-ce7e5dded880f221)\n\n### 7. The European Central Bank kept its three key interest rates unchanged as cooling inflation in the Eurozone triggered a wait-and-see approach.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Yahoo Finance, BIS, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest news from Frankfurt, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced at its first monetary policy meeting of 2026 that it would maintain interest rates unchanged. Currently, the deposit facility rate, the main refinancing rate, and the marginal lending rate remain stable at 2.0%, 2.15%, and 2.40%, respectively. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed out that although the Eurozone's inflation rate fell to 1.7% in January, below the official target of 2%, uncertainties in global trade policy and geopolitics still require policymakers to remain vigilant. Bundesbank President Nagel also reiterated that policy decisions must be based on a comprehensive assessment of the inflation outlook and the strength of its transmission. Market analysts generally believe that the ECB has officially entered a \"wait-and-see\" period, with most economists expecting interest rates to remain stable throughout 2026, and inflation expected to hover around 1.9%. Whether further adjustments will be made will highly depend on the strength of the global economic recovery.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Yahoo Finance](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/ecb-holds-interest-rates-eurozone-inflation-january-131646998.html)\n  - [2] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/interest-rate)\n\n### 8. Geopolitical tensions are showing signs of easing, leading to risk aversion in global financial markets.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest macroeconomic data released by Trading Economics, global financial markets exhibited a delicate balance of volatility on February 18th. On the one hand, geopolitical tensions eased significantly with the US-Iran nuclear agreement reaching a \"guiding principle\" understanding and initial progress reported in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Boosted by this positive news, European stock futures rose 0.3% before the market opened on Wednesday. However, the US dollar index remained strong, rising to 97.28, while the euro-dollar exchange rate remained around 1.1843. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note slightly decreased to 4.03%. Investor sentiment is generally cautious, with market focus shifting from geopolitical conflicts to the upcoming final French inflation readings and the Federal Reserve meeting minutes, attempting to find clearer coordinates for the direction of global monetary policy in 2026.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/currency)\n  - [2] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/stock-market/news/526561)\n\n### 9. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy normalization is imminent, while strong chip exports coexist with a weak economy.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, MarketScreener\n- **Summary**: According to our Tokyo correspondent, the yen has recently fallen to around 153.5 against the dollar, with market expectations for the Bank of Japan to normalize its monetary policy at an all-time high. Data shows that driven by demand for artificial intelligence chips, Japan's exports in January saw a three-year high, surging nearly 17%. However, at the same time, Japan's weak fourth-quarter GDP performance has created a ambivalent sentiment in the market. Currently, most traders are betting that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates in April. Furthermore, the fiscal policy stance of the Sanae Takaichi government is also considered a key variable influencing the central bank's decision. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its latest commentary, reiterated that it does not recommend using a specific yen exchange rate level as an intervention target, emphasizing that market supply and demand should determine currency movements, making the future trajectory of the yen and Japanese government bonds even more unpredictable.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/currency)\n  - [2] [MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/clean-energy-transition-transcript-from-the-february-18-2026-critical-minerals-update-2026-02-18-ce7e5dded880f221)\n\n### 10. Japan and the United States reached a $550 billion investment agreement, with strategic energy and mineral projects to be located in the United States.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Livemint, Access24, Investing.com\n- **Summary**: According to our station, US President Trump recently announced that Japan and the US have formally reached an investment agreement totaling $550 billion in the US. The initial investment of approximately $36 billion will be precisely targeted at core US energy and industrial sectors. According to the publicly available project list, SoftBank's SB Power will build a massive $33 billion gas-fired power plant in Ohio, while Texas and Georgia will respectively welcome liquefied natural gas export facilities and strategic mineral processing plants. Notably, this cooperation employs a unique profit-sharing model: profits will be split 50/50 until Japan recoups its initial investment, after which the US's share will significantly increase to 90%. This agreement is seen as a crucial step in boosting the US industrial base and strengthening its energy dominance. It is reported that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will visit the US on March 19 to further confirm details of the subsequent investments.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Livemint](https://www.livemint.com/economy/trump-announces-massive-investments-in-us-by-japan-as-part-of-550-billion-commitment-minerals-oil-gas-11771373655030.html)\n  - [2] [Investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-announces-energy-critical-mineral-projects-in-texas-ohio-georgia-4118103)\n\n### 11. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, financial markets in many parts of Asia were closed, leading to a reduction in liquidity.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Business Recorder, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: On February 18th, Asian financial markets entered their traditionally quiet trading period due to the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. According to our reports, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) were all closed today. Among the markets that remained open, the Tokyo Nikkei index performed actively, boosted by the positive news of the Japan-US trade agreement, closing at 57,143.84 points; the Indian Sensex index also showed a steady trend. However, due to the lack of liquidity caused by the closure of major markets, overall market trading volume shrank significantly. Traders are adjusting their risk exposure using historical data, generally expecting increased volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets when liquidity returns after the holiday. The US dollar index remained high at 97.26 during the Asian session, reflecting that global investors still tend to hold the US dollar as a safe-haven asset during the holiday.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/currency)\n  - [2] [Business Recorder](https://www.brecorder.com/opinion)\n\n### 12. Global commodities rallied across the board: Gold and silver prices climbed, reflecting cautious sentiment.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: New Indian Express, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest price data monitored by this station, despite the strong performance of the US dollar index, the global commodity market still showed a collective upward trend on February 18. Crude oil prices rose 0.23% to $62.47 per barrel, with the market expecting it to potentially reach $63.74 by the end of the quarter. In contrast, precious metals performed even better, with gold prices rising 0.73% to $4,914.99 per ounce, representing a staggering 67.43% increase over the past year. Silver prices saw the most rapid growth, with a daily increase approaching 3%, reaching $75.72. Analysts believe that this rare phenomenon of commodities and the US dollar strengthening in tandem reflects investors' risk-averse impulses amid multiple uncertainties. Currently, the market is entering a consolidation phase, and investors are closely monitoring the inflation trajectory and the policy pace of major central banks to assess the sustainability of the commodity price rally.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2026/Feb/18/markets-brace-for-a-cautious-start-as-they-enter-a-consolidation-mode)\n  - [2] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/crude-oil)\n\n### 13. OECD and Goldman Sachs predict that the negative impact of global tariffs will reach its peak in 2026.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Yahoo Finance, BBC\n- **Summary**: A recent report from the OECD indicates that the negative impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies on the global economy will fully materialize in 2026. The report analyzes that with the global average tariff rate rising to 19.5%, global GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.9%. Goldman Sachs, in its latest forecast, also noted that while the government encourages increased production, tariffs have driven up equipment costs, causing the break-even point for US shale oil to rise to $65, far exceeding the government's expected $50. Meanwhile, affected by tariffs, US-China trade has declined for the third consecutive year, and tariffs have directly contributed 0.3% to 0.5% to US inflation. In the energy market, influenced by strong US and Russian production, Brent crude oil prices are expected to fall to around $56 this year. These data suggest that 2026 will be a year of profound interplay between global trade patterns and inflationary pressures.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/full-effects-trump-tariff-hikes-201921342.html)\n  - [2] [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czejp3gep63o)\n\n### 14. The Congressional Budget Office released its 2026 outlook: Interest payments may double within a decade.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-12\n- **Source**: American Action Forum\n- **Summary**: According to a recent report from the American Action Forum, cited by this station, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its highly anticipated \"Budget and Economic Outlook\" report on February 12, 2026. The report issued a stark fiscal warning: constrained by the massive debt base and interest rate environment, interest payments on U.S. Treasury bonds are projected to double by 2036. The report indicates that this growth trend will make interest payments one of the fastest-growing areas in the federal budget. Analysts worry that the increasingly heavy burden of debt interest payments will significantly squeeze future fiscal space in areas such as scientific research, infrastructure, and social security. This is not only a domestic fiscal concern in the United States but could also have a profound impact on the long-term stability of global capital markets.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [American Action Forum](https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/highlights-of-cbos-february-2026-budget-and-economic-outlook/)\n\n### 15. Dallas Fed Focuses on Financing for AI Infrastructure: Technology Credit is Becoming a New Focus of Financial Research\n- **Time**: 2026-02-12\n- **Source**: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n- **Summary**: A recent briefing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that the bank is shifting its research focus to financing models for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and its impact on the macroeconomy. The report points out that as the global AI industry enters a period of deep application by 2026, the construction of data centers and computing facilities will generate enormous financing demands. The Dallas Fed's research found that this new type of infrastructure investment not only changes traditional corporate lending structures but may also have complex effects on inflation paths and productivity gains. This development suggests that the Federal Reserve system is closely monitoring how technological revolutions are fundamentally reshaping financial risk management, thus preparing a basis for future monetary policy decisions.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas](https://www.dallasfed.org/)\n\n### 16. The Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of 2026 concludes: interest rates to remain unchanged to observe economic resilience.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-28\n- **Source**: J.P. Morgan\n- **Summary**: According to a recent economic analysis report released by JP Morgan, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its first policy meeting in 2026. This decision reflects the committee's balancing act between \"inflation returning to its target\" and \"ensuring a soft landing for the economy.\" It is observed that the Fed holds a cautiously optimistic view of the current restrictive interest rate level, believing it necessary to observe the situation for a period to confirm the sustainability of the downward trend in inflation. Market analysts believe that this decision to maintain the interest rate is essentially setting a \"prudent wait-and-see\" tone for monetary policy throughout the year, aiming to guide market expectations back to rationality and avoid the risk of an inflation rebound caused by premature interest rate cuts.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/markets-and-economy/economy/fed-meeting-january-2026)\n\n### 17. The UK has made significant progress in combating inflation: the inflation rate is expected to fall to a ten-month low.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: The Telegraph\n- **Summary**: Turning our attention to Europe, the UK economy is approaching a crucial turning point, with inflation expected to fall to its lowest level in nearly 10 months this month, according to The Daily Telegraph. This indicates that the Bank of England's previously implemented tightening monetary policy is having the desired effect. The report cites economists who say that stabilizing energy prices and the recovery of supply chains are the main drivers of the cooling inflation. Nevertheless, the Bank of England remains vigilant in its public statements, emphasizing that the tightness of the labor market and the stubbornness of core inflation still require attention. This easing of inflation provides the UK with more room to maneuver in adjusting its macroeconomic policies beyond 2026.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/18/inflation-expected-to-fall-to-10-month-low/)\n\n### 18. Global markets are focused on key personnel nominations: Kevin Warsh's nomination sparks policy expectations.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-01\n- **Source**: Wealth Management Midwest\n- **Summary**: According to Wealth Management Midwest's February market update, global financial markets are closely watching Kevin Warsh's latest nomination. As a veteran who previously held a senior position at the Federal Reserve, Warsh's return suggests a potential subtle shift in the style of US monetary policy implementation. According to our sources, investors are closely analyzing his past policy leanings, particularly his stance on inflation control and financial regulation. The market generally believes that this significant personnel change could be a key indicator of the Fed's policy shift in 2026. Influenced by this expectation, volatility in both the bond and stock markets has increased in the short term, indicating that market sensitivity to policy uncertainty remains high.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Wealth Management Midwest](https://wealthmanagementmidwest.com/newsletters-and-updates/monthly-market-update-february-2026)\n\n### 19. Financial Market Overview: The Federal Reserve kept lending rates stable and maintained continuity in macroeconomic policy.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Yahoo Finance\n- **Summary**: According to the latest market overview released by Yahoo Finance, the Federal Reserve has demonstrated strong consistency in its policy implementation since entering 2026, continuing to maintain stable lending rates at high levels. This approach aims to further squeeze out residual inflationary pressures. Our reporter, through summarizing data from multiple sources, found that although there were urgent market expectations for interest rate cuts, Federal Reserve officials have consistently emphasized in recent public speeches that data-dependent approaches remain the core principle. It has been observed that while this stable interest rate environment has put some pressure on the manufacturing and real estate sectors, it has also effectively prevented excessive expansion of financial leverage, acting as a \"ballast\" for the stability of the global financial environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-keeps-interest-rates-steady-185300745.html)\n\n### 20. China's Ministry of Finance stated that a more proactive fiscal policy will be implemented in 2026, with a moderate expansion of spending.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-20\n- **Source**: The Standard / Xinhua\n- **Summary**: According to our station, Chinese Ministry of Finance officials released a strong signal at a press conference on January 20, 2026. Officials stated that to ensure a good start to the 14th Five-Year Plan, China will continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy in 2026, and explicitly proposed to appropriately expand the scale of fiscal expenditure. The core focus of this policy orientation covers expanding domestic demand, supporting cutting-edge technological innovation, prudently resolving local government debt risks, and safeguarding people's livelihoods. Despite the current challenges facing the macroeconomy, Ministry of Finance officials emphasized that China's current debt ratio remains at a low level, providing sufficient policy flexibility and fiscal strength, which lays a solid foundation for stable economic growth throughout the year.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Standard / Xinhua](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/market/article/322099/China-will-maintain-'necessary'-fiscal-deficit-and-debt-levels-in-2026)\n\n### 21. Goldman Sachs has raised its 2026 China economic growth forecast to 4.8%, with surging exports being the core driver.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-08\n- **Source**: Goldman Sachs\n- **Summary**: A recent report from Goldman Sachs Research indicates the firm is optimistic about China's GDP growth rate in 2026. Goldman Sachs predicts that despite the ongoing long process of the domestic real estate market bottoming out, China's economic growth rate is expected to reach 4.8% in 2026, strongly supported by a surge in export trade and continued easing of monetary and fiscal policies. This forecast is significantly higher than the current market consensus of 4.5%. The report points out that this better-than-expected growth is mainly due to the strong competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector and the resilience shown by the government in structural adjustments, indicating that China's position in the global supply chain remains solid.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/chinas-economy-expected-to-grow-in-2026-amid-surging-exports)\n\n### 22. A Reuters survey suggests that Beijing may set its 2026 GDP growth target between 4.5% and 5%.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-23\n- **Source**: Reuters\n- **Summary**: A recent Reuters survey of several government advisors and economists suggests that the Chinese government may set its 2026 growth target at around 4.5% to 5% at its upcoming meeting. The survey results indicate that despite facing medium- to long-term challenges such as an aging population and external trade pressures, policymakers still favor deep structural reforms and fiscal expansion policies to prevent the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral. This target reflects Beijing's trade-off between pursuing high-quality development and maintaining a necessary growth rate, aiming to stabilize market confidence and expectations through policy certainty.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-likely-set-2026-gdp-growth-target-between-45-5-scmp-says-2026-01-23/)\n\n### 23. The Year of the Horse Spring Festival was full of technology: humanoid robot performances became a highlight of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: The Korea Times\n- **Summary**: According to a special correspondent for this station, during the 2026 Lunar New Year (Year of the Horse), Chinese people experienced a strong festive atmosphere amidst traditional prayers and dazzling fireworks. Of particular note was the humanoid robot performance by leading companies such as Unitree Robotics on this year's CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which became a focal point of national discussion. The robots' high degree of flexibility and collaborative capabilities not only added a technological dimension to the festival but also showcased China's substantial investment and R&D achievements in artificial intelligence and advanced robot hardware to the world. This signifies that China's high technology has moved from the laboratory to mass consumer culture, becoming a new calling card for showcasing comprehensive national strength.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/)\n\n### 24. China's visa-free policy for the UK and Canada took effect on February 17, promoting high-level opening up to the outside world.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-15\n- **Source**: Global Times / Xinhua\n- **Summary**: The Chinese Foreign Ministry recently confirmed that starting February 17, 2026, China will officially implement a visa-free policy for citizens of Canada and the United Kingdom. According to sources, this move is a key step in implementing a high-level opening-up policy, aiming to further promote people-to-people exchanges, economic and trade cooperation, and cultural interaction between China and Canada, and between China and the United Kingdom.

New loans in China jumped in January but fell short of expectations, as weak domestic demand continued to constrain business investment confidence.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-13\n- **Source**: Reuters / The Standard\n- **Summary**: According to data cited by Reuters, new RMB loans in China showed a seasonal rebound in January 2026, but the final figure still fell short of market expectations.

This data reflects that the foundation for the current macroeconomic recovery still needs further consolidation. Experts suggest that more targeted policy tools may be needed in the future to revitalize micro-entities and improve the efficiency of financial support for the real economy.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters / The Standard](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/market/article/322099/China-will-maintain-'necessary'-fiscal-deficit-and-debt-levels-in-2026)\n\n### 26.
