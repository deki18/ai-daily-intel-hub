This decision aims to stabilize the Indonesian rupiah exchange rate and support economic growth, despite pressure from some members of parliament. Latest data shows that Indonesia's inflation rate in December has fallen back into the central bank's target range, while foreign exchange reserves increased to US$143.6 billion, providing support for maintaining stable monetary policy. Market observers point out that this move reflects the central bank's prudent balance between economic stability and political pressure.\n- **References**:\n  - [3] [Central Banking](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banksmonetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions)\n\n### 4. China maintains its loan prime rate unchanged.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-03\n- **Source**: Central Banking\n- **Summary**: According to an announcement from the People's Bank of China, the one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPRs) remained at 3% and 3.5%, respectively. The central bank reiterated its commitment to targeted easing through structural tools, rather than a comprehensive interest rate cut. Data shows that corporate medium- and long-term loans increased by 17% year-on-year in January, indicating that the precise control policies are taking effect. Analysts believe this reflects the policymakers' efforts to strike a balance between supporting the real economy and preventing financial risks.\n- **References**:\n  - [4] [Central Banking](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banksmonetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions)\n\n### 5.

Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized that the current economic uncertainties mainly stem from political turmoil in the United States and the risks associated with trade negotiations. Although domestic inflation in Canada has fallen back into the target range, data shows that exports to the United States still account for as much as 20% of GDP. Economists warn that policy shifts during a US election year could severely impact the Canadian dollar exchange rate and cross-border capital flows.\n- **References**:\n  - [6] [Central Banking](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banksmonetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions)\n\n### 7.

Data shows that the return on capital for the world's five largest oil companies has fallen from 23% in the same period last year to 16%.\n- **References**:\n  - [20] [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/sitemap_news.xml)\n\n### 12.
