Today is February 6, 2026. Welcome to today's Daily News. In the past 24 hours, global financial markets and geopolitical situations have intertwined to create an extremely complex picture. The resurgence of inflationary pressures in the United States has directly impacted market expectations for interest rate cuts, with the dollar index climbing to a multi-month high. Meanwhile, personnel changes and independence controversies within the Federal Reserve are becoming the focus of political maneuvering in Washington. Across the Pacific, the phone call between the top leaders of China and the United States brought positive signals to bilateral trade, particularly a significant boost to commodity purchases. However, global stock markets have not been calmed; a sell-off in AI technology stocks triggered a sharp correction in the Nasdaq. Even more surprisingly, risk aversion has pushed gold prices to the historic $5,000 per ounce mark. In today's program, we will delve into the logic of inflation, the divergence in central bank policies, and the underlying reasons for the dramatic fluctuations in global asset prices. Below is a detailed summary of the key news items for this episode.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. US core inflation remains high at 3%, and the market expects the Federal Reserve to significantly slow the pace of interest rate cuts.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Reuters, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to Reuters and various economic data monitoring, inflationary pressures in the United States have shown a significant rebound in the past 24 hours. The latest report indicates that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate is currently holding at 3%, a figure not only far above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%, but also showing a further upward trend. As a result, the market has drastically revised its expectations regarding the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shift. Based on current interest rate futures pricing, the market generally predicts that the Fed will adopt a more cautious path, expecting only two rate cuts throughout 2026, while the originally anticipated first rate cut may be postponed to June of this year.

The dollar index posted its strongest performance since November of last year, and the Atlanta Fed raised its GDP forecast.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: KFGO, InstaForex\n- **Summary**: According to our report, the US dollar index (DXY) has recently performed strongly, driven by both stronger inflation data and safe-haven flows, currently trading around 97.96, marking its strongest weekly performance since November of last year. Meanwhile, the latest data released by the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model shows that the US economy remained resilient in the fourth quarter of last year, with an estimated growth rate of 4.2%. InstaForex analysis points out that this strong economic fundamentals provide strong support for the dollar, but the widespread rise in global commodity prices is exacerbating the risk of imported inflation. Investors are currently closely watching whether a stronger dollar will further weaken the stability of other emerging market currencies.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [KFGO](https://kfgo.com/2026/02/05/dollar-set-for-strongest-week-since-november-yen-steadies-before-polls/)\n\n### 3. Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chairman has sparked legal controversy regarding his policy independence.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Associated Press, Politico\n- **Summary**: According to the Associated Press and Politico, President Trump's nominee for the next Federal Reserve Chairman, Kevin Warsh, has recently attracted widespread attention in Washington. Treasury Secretary Bessant made surprising remarks at his hearing, stating that if Warsh refuses to implement interest rate cuts after taking office, the decision to prosecute him would be up to the president. This statement quickly sparked market concerns about the Fed's policy independence. Warsh has long been considered a \"hawk,\" favoring balance sheet reduction and deregulation. Analysts warn that political interference in monetary policy decisions could damage the long-term credibility of the dollar and lead to a significant increase in inflation volatility. The market is currently closely watching for policy continuity after current Chairman Powell's term expires in May.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Associated Press](https://www.newstribune.com/news/2026/feb/06/bessent-says-its-up-to-trump-whether-to-sue-his/)\n\n### 4. The resignation of Miranda, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, signals a potential restructuring of the Federal Reserve's internal power structure.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Politico\n- **Summary**: According to a report by Politico, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran officially resigned as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers on Tuesday. This move is seen as a signal of a restructuring of the Fed's internal power structure. With Kevin Warsh's nomination, Miran's departure may indicate the White House's desire for greater alignment in economic policy implementation. Currently, there are differing opinions within the Fed regarding future balance sheet reduction plans and regulatory easing agendas. Market analysts believe that such high-level personnel changes may increase uncertainty in short-term policy guidance, particularly in balancing deregulation with financial system stability; the new leadership's approach will be crucial.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/05/deregulatory-push-fed-warsh-00762710)\n\n### 5. U.S. job openings fell to a four-year low in December, indicating a cooling labor market.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Haver Analytics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest economic data released by Haver Analytics, the number of JOLTS job openings in the US fell to its lowest level since September 2020 in December, indicating a significant slowdown in hiring demand in the labor market. Meanwhile, the latest weekly surge in initial jobless claims further corroborates the cooling signal in the job market. Despite this, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain the federal funds rate at 3.50% to 3.75% at its policy meeting at the end of January. The Fed emphasized the need to maintain a high degree of balance between maintaining employment stability and curbing a rebound in inflation. The market generally believes that if future non-farm payroll data continues to be revised downwards, it will force the Fed to restart its rate-cutting cycle.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Haver Analytics](https://www.haver.com/economy-in-brief)\n\n### 6. Trump held a phone conversation with Chinese leaders, calling the call \"excellent.\"\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Military.com (AP)\n- **Summary**: According to the Associated Press, US President Donald Trump recently held an in-depth telephone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump subsequently stated publicly on social media that the call yielded \"very good\" results, with both sides exchanging views on a range of global issues, including the situation in Iran and bilateral trade. This call is seen by many as a sign of easing tensions between the US and China after a period of strain. While reports also touched upon the regional situation involving Taiwan, both sides expressed a preference for managing differences through high-level dialogue. This development has had a significant positive effect on stabilizing global market expectations.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com (AP)](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/05/taiwan-us-ties-are-rock-solid-islands-president-says-after-trump-xi-call.html)\n\n### 7. China plans to significantly increase its purchases of US soybeans, aiming to raise the total to 20 million tons this quarter.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Military.com (AP)\n- **Summary**: According to our comprehensive report, substantial progress has recently emerged in Sino-US trade. Details following the phone call between the Chinese and US leaders indicate that China is considering significantly increasing its soybean purchases from the US this quarter, planning to raise the volume from 12 million tons last quarter to 20 million tons. This move not only helps narrow the bilateral trade deficit but is also seen as an important action by China to fulfill its trade commitments and stabilize confidence in the US agricultural market. Commodity analysts point out that such a large order will provide strong support for soybean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade and marks a new stage in agricultural trade cooperation between the two countries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com (AP)](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/05/taiwan-us-ties-are-rock-solid-islands-president-says-after-trump-xi-call.html)\n\n### 8. Trump plans to make his first trip to China during his presidency in April to ease trade tensions.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Military.com (AP)\n- **Summary**: According to the latest information obtained by this station, US President Trump plans to embark on his first official visit to China during his presidency in April this year. This trip, following the phone call between the Chinese and US leaders, is widely interpreted by the international community as an important step for both sides to seek to ease trade frictions and establish a long-term communication mechanism. Analysts point out that although competition remains on tariffs and in the technology sector, this planned visit to China indicates that both sides are willing to avoid miscalculations and seek common ground through face-to-face diplomatic contact. Following this announcement, market confidence in related trade-related stocks and multinational corporations has significantly recovered.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com (AP)](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/05/taiwan-us-ties-are-rock-solid-islands-president-says-after-trump-xi-call.html)\n\n### 9. The Hang Seng Index rebounded slightly to 26,885 points, with investors focusing on the implementation of subsequent fiscal stimulus measures.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: AAStocks, MacroMicro\n- **Summary**: According to data released by AAStocks, as of the closing bell on February 5, 2026, Hong Kong stocks performed steadily, with the Hang Seng Index (HSI) rising slightly by 37 points to 26,885. Meanwhile, the H-share index also rose by 0.5%. In the macro bond market, the yield on China's 10-year government bonds remained stable at around 1.8030%, indicating that market liquidity remained moderately balanced. Currently, investors' attention has turned to the industrial production data to be released in February. The market generally expects to find evidence of the implementation of fiscal stimulus policies, thereby providing a more solid foundation for the continued recovery of the Chinese economy in 2026.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [AAStocks](http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/analysis/china-hot-topic-content.aspx?catg=4&type=16&id=NOW.1501399&source=AAFN)\n\n### 10. The European Central Bank held rates steady for the fifth consecutive time, with Lagarde reiterating that policy decisions depend on data.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Reuters, Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to Reuters, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept interest rates unchanged at its first monetary policy meeting of 2026, marking the fifth consecutive time the bank has decided to hold rates steady. The main refinancing rate remains at 2.15%. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted at a press conference that while inflation is trending towards the 2% target, the stubbornness of inflation in the services sector remains a concern. Lagarde downplayed the impact of recent cooling data, refused to commit to any predetermined path of rate cuts, and emphasized that subsequent decisions will depend entirely on data performance in March and beyond. Influenced by this hawkish statement, market expectations for a rate cut in March have fallen from 50% to approximately 30%.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://klse.i3investor.com/web/blog/detail/mercurysec/2026-02-06-story-h500676636-Daily_Newswatch_6_Feb_2026)\n\n### 11. Eurozone GDP grew 1.3% in the fourth quarter, exceeding expectations and demonstrating unexpected economic resilience.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: MacroMicro\n- **Summary**: According to macroeconomic data provided by MacroMicro, the Eurozone economy outperformed market expectations in the fourth quarter of last year. Preliminary real GDP figures showed a year-on-year increase of 1.3% and a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.3%. Despite current geopolitical tensions and uncertainties surrounding global trade policy, the Eurozone economy has demonstrated strong resilience. Analysts believe that this growth momentum, combined with easing price pressures, has reduced the urgency for policymakers to provide further monetary policy support. However, performance has diverged among different member states, and the market is closely watching whether this recovery is sustainable.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MacroMicro](https://en.macromicro.me/quickie?id=1929)\n\n### 12. German industrial output unexpectedly declined, and manufacturing disparities sparked policy divergences within the Eurozone.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: MacroMicro\n- **Summary**: According to our correspondent in Europe, while the Eurozone as a whole is experiencing positive growth, a discordant note has emerged in the German economy. Latest data shows an unexpected decline in German industrial output, highlighting the continued vulnerability of the manufacturing sector, the engine of the European economy, to fluctuations in energy costs and external demand. This disparity with the economic performance of other Eurozone countries is sparking internal debate about the direction of monetary policy. Economists worry that continued weakness in German manufacturing could drag down the pace of recovery across the Eurozone and force the European Central Bank into a more complex decision-making environment in the coming months.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MacroMicro](https://en.macromicro.me/quickie?id=1929)\n\n### 13. Bank of Japan policy board member Koichi Masuko: Further interest rate hikes are necessary to complete the normalization process.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Japan Times\n- **Summary**: According to The Japan Times, Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member Kazuyuki Masu stated today in Ehime Prefecture that a further increase in the policy interest rate is essential to normalize Japan's monetary policy. Masu believes that raising interest rates will not only narrow the interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies, but more importantly, effectively alleviate the pressure of rising import costs caused by the prolonged weakness of the yen. Previously, the BOJ raised interest rates to 0.75% in December of last year. Masu's statement reinforced market expectations for another rate hike at the BOJ's March meeting, thus providing some support for the yen's exchange rate.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2026/02/06/economy/boj-member-signal-rate-hikes/)\n\n### 14. With the Japanese House of Representatives election approaching, Sanae Takaichi has expressed support for a weaker yen to counter tariffs.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: MUFG, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and related election research, the Japanese House of Representatives election will be held on February 8th. In her latest campaign speech, incumbent Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi explicitly expressed support for a weak yen, believing it would provide a strong buffer for Japanese auto exports and protect against potential tariff shocks. Although polls indicate the ruling coalition is likely to secure a stable majority of approximately 261 seats, the market is concerned about the expansionary fiscal policies Takaichi might implement, which could further increase Japan's already heavy public debt. Currently, market sentiment fluctuates between election uncertainty and reflation expectations.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://www.economies.com/forex/usd-jpy-news/yen-about-to-mark-biggest-weekly-loss-in-2026-on-japanese-elections-48256)\n\n### 15. The yen faces its biggest weekly drop since 2026, with the finance minister warning of decisive action.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Bloomberg, RTTNews\n- **Summary**: According to Bloomberg, although the yen rose slightly to 156.51 against the dollar on Friday, it is facing its worst weekly decline since the beginning of 2026 due to election uncertainty and interest rate differential pressures. Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama expressed strong concern about the recent \"excessive and disorderly\" depreciation of the yen and explicitly warned that the Japanese government reserves the right to intervene decisively in the foreign exchange market. Analysts point out that the sharp fluctuations in the yen's exchange rate not only affect imported prices but also put the Bank of Japan in a dilemma when adjusting its interest rate policy, and the market is highly vigilant for any substantial intervention signals.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-uP2NkgQvw)\n\n### 16. Japanese household spending unexpectedly declined in December, as rising living costs significantly dampened consumer spending.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: RTTNews\n- **Summary**: According to the latest economic survey released by RTT News, Japanese household spending unexpectedly fell by 2.6% in December, a figure far below market expectations. The study shows that the continuously rising cost of living, particularly food and energy prices driven up by the weak yen, has significantly dampened the purchasing power of ordinary Japanese households. This signal of weak consumption has exacerbated market concerns about the dynamism of domestic demand in the Japanese economy. Economists believe that this contraction in household spending may lead the Bank of Japan to adopt a more cautious approach when considering further interest rate hikes, so as not to unduly damage already fragile consumer confidence.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [RTTNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-uP2NkgQvw)\n\n### 17. Global monetary policy divergence is widening, with the Bank of Japan standing alone in its commitment to tightening monetary policy.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Reuters\n- **Summary**: A Reuters in-depth analysis points out that while major central banks worldwide are generally slowing their pace of interest rate hikes or even considering rate cuts, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is currently the only major central bank adhering to a tightening path. This significant policy divergence has transformed the BOJ from a former \"outlier\" into a \"policy pioneer.\" Japan's current inflation rate remains around 3%, consistently above the target. To balance inflation and debt costs, the BOJ has had to intervene by raising interest rates and reducing its bond-buying program. This global policy divergence is the core driver of the recent sharp fluctuations in the yen and global bond markets.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/global-markets-central-banks-graphic-2026-02-05/)\n\n### 18. Moody's downgraded Indonesia's credit rating outlook to negative, and the Indonesian rupiah is nearing a historic low.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Reuters, Moody's\n- **Summary**: According to Reuters, Moody's Investors Service revised its outlook on Indonesia's credit rating from \"stable\" to \"negative\" yesterday. Moody's cited reduced predictability of the new Indonesian government's policies and weakened governance as the main reasons for the downgrade. Affected by this significant negative news, the Indonesian IDX Composite Index fell sharply by 1.5% yesterday, while the Indonesian rupiah continued to be under pressure, currently trading around 16,985, nearing its historical low. Data shows that foreign capital has seen a net outflow of approximately $860 million from the Indonesian stock market in the past week. Market analysts believe that while Indonesia's 5.11% economic growth target for 2025 is fast, it falls short of the government's expectations, and the weak macroeconomic data has further shaken investor confidence.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/06/indonesian-markets-face-more-pressure-after-moody039s-cuts-outlook)\n\n### 19. India's SENSEX index rose slightly as the US-India agricultural trade agreement lowered tariff thresholds.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, New Indian Express\n- **Summary**: According to The New Indian Express, India's SENSEX stock index bucked the trend today, rising 0.32% to close at 83,580 points. Despite significant global market volatility, the recent trade agreement between the US and India injected momentum into the market. This agreement stipulates a substantial reduction in tariffs on Indian agricultural exports to the US from 50% to 18%. However, market research also warns that uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy remains the biggest threat to emerging markets. It is estimated that a 1% increase in US policy uncertainty could lead to capital outflows equivalent to 0.3% of GDP for emerging Asian economies. Currently, the Reserve Bank of India is maintaining its benchmark interest rate at 5.25% to address potential external shocks.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/stock-market)\n\n### 20. Singapore's manufacturing outlook cools in 2026 as geopolitical risks exacerbate growth challenges.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Business Times\n- **Summary**: According to the latest industry assessment published by the Business Times, the outlook for Singapore's manufacturing sector in 2026 appears rather bleak. Affected by the combined effects of global geopolitical uncertainty and slowing external demand, growth in Singapore's manufacturing sector is expected to slow significantly. Analysts point out that as a highly export-dependent economy, Singapore is facing the dual pressures of global supply chain restructuring and fluctuating tariff policies. Although the government is actively promoting digital transformation and green manufacturing, significant structural challenges remain in the short term. Businesses are currently generally cautious, scaling back future equipment investment plans.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/keywords/singapore)\n\n### 21. The Philippines' economic growth in 2025 is projected to hit its lowest level since 2011, hindering the central bank's path of interest rate cuts.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: BusinessMirror\n- **Summary**: According to BusinessMirror, the Philippines' GDP growth rate has slowed to 4.4% by 2025, the slowest pace since 2011, excluding the exceptional years of the pandemic. This economic downturn has directly led to significant volatility in the job market. Against this backdrop, the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) is stuck in a stalemate regarding interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, as such cuts could further exacerbate downward pressure on the local currency. Nevertheless, the Philippine government is demonstrating a proactive approach to transformation, striving to become a digital connectivity leader in Southeast Asia in hopes of attracting more foreign investment in the technology sector and mitigating the risks of declining traditional industries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [BusinessMirror](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2026/02/06/tepid-gdp-growth-leads-to-job-volatility-in-2025-study/)\n\n### 22. Confidence in Malaysia's property market is rebounding, with transaction volume projected to reach RM250 billion by 2026.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: The Star\n- **Summary**: According to a report by The Star, Malaysia's property market is entering a new boom cycle. Market analysts predict that the total value of Malaysian property transactions could reach RM250 billion by 2026. This optimistic outlook is driven by an influx of investment in AI-driven data centers and continued infrastructure development. Demand for industrial land and commercial real estate remains strong, particularly in Johor and the Klang Valley. Investors generally believe that in the current environment of global currency volatility, Malaysian physical assets, with their relatively stable policy environment and solid rental yields, are becoming an ideal destination for safe-haven funds.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Star](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/06/indonesian-markets-face-more-pressure-after-moody039s-cuts-outlook)\n\n### 23. Vietnam's stock market further eases foreign investment restrictions, seeking to attract more institutional investors.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Business Times\n- **Summary**: According to our station, Vietnam's financial regulators recently announced new reform measures aimed at further easing the barriers for foreign investors to enter its domestic stock market. This move is seen as a key step in Vietnam's efforts to upgrade its capital market from a \"frontier market\" to an \"emerging market.\" The new policy not only streamlines the account opening process but also allows foreign capital to hold higher percentages of shares in more core sectors. Analysts believe that in the current climate of intensifying competition in Southeast Asia, Vietnam's efforts to attract long-term, stable capital flows through institutional optimization will help strengthen the resilience of its financial system and provide ample financial support for the expansion of domestic technology and manufacturing companies.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/keywords/singapore)\n\n### 24. Japanese companies are increasing their investment in India's mining and automotive industries; Aisin plans to build two new factories.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Nikkei Forum\n- **Summary**: According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Japanese companies are continuing to deepen their presence in the Indian market. Aisin, a Japanese auto parts giant, announced plans to build two new modern parts factories in India to meet the growing demand for automotive manufacturing. Furthermore, Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) announced plans to sell high-tech photo printers and auto parts in India. Meanwhile, the Indian government announced a $166 million investment in modernizing key mineral recycling technologies, which aligns closely with the investment direction of Japanese companies in the sustainable use of resources. This deep integration of the Japan-India industrial chain is becoming a new model for economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Nikkei Forum](https://nikkeiforum.com/foa25en/)\n\n### 25. Global AI tech stocks experienced a sell-off, with the Nasdaq index falling nearly 4% for the week.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Saxo Bank, The Telegraph\n- **Summary**: According to a joint report by Saxo Bank and The Telegraph, global stock markets experienced significant volatility in the past 24 hours, particularly with large-scale profit-taking in the previously leading AI technology sector. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.9% for the week, and the S&P 500 also hit a seven-week low. Tech giants led by Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce saw the largest declines. Analysts point out that investors are reassessing the true return on AI capital expenditures in a high-interest-rate environment and are concerned about the uncertainty surrounding software companies due to the impact of their own technologies. Although the VIX fear index has risen, the market currently tends to define it as a corrective pullback rather than a complete collapse.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Bank](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/06/ftse-100-markets-ai-software-tech-wall-street-uk-us/)\n\n### 26. US Treasury yields fell as weak jobs data weighed on the pound, while the pound plunged on expectations of an interest rate cut.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Saxo Bank, InstaForex\n- **Summary**: According to the latest forex market analysis released by InstaForex, US Treasury yields have retreated from recent highs due to significantly weaker-than-expected US private sector employment data for January. This weaker data has had a ripple effect in the foreign exchange market. The pound sterling plummeted against the dollar due to the Bank of England's dovish stance and expectations of a potential interest rate cut. Meanwhile, although the euro rebounded to 1.18 against the dollar due to the ECB's hawkish position, global risk aversion has made investors very hesitant in their currency allocation. The strength of the US dollar remains the core variable influencing the trends of non-US dollar currencies globally.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Bank](https://www.home.saxo/en-gb/content/articles/macro/market-quick-take---6-february-2026-06022026)\n\n### 27. Gold prices surged more than 3% to near the $5,000 mark as concerns about sovereign debt triggered safe-haven buying.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, Economies.com\n- **Summary**: According to our financial observations, global safe-haven funds are flowing into the precious metals market at an unprecedented pace. Gold prices surged over 3% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4,930 per ounce, just shy of the historic $5,000 mark. Meanwhile, silver prices also jumped nearly 7% to $75.64. Analysts point out that global sovereign debt has reached a staggering $320 trillion, and the crisis of confidence in the traditional fiat currency system is forcing capital to seek safe havens. WEEX's analysis even refers to this as a \"digital lifeboat\" in the global debt crisis. Furthermore, the upcoming Chinese New Year consumption peak is also providing seasonal support for gold's strong performance.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold)\n\n### 28. BRICS+ countries explore gold standard settlement system; silver prices rise nearly 7% in a single day.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: WEEX, Economies.com\n- **Summary**: According to the latest macro report released by WEEX, as the BRICS+ (Brazil, India, China, Europe, and the United States) accelerates its shift towards a diversified settlement architecture potentially centered on the gold standard, the strategic position of precious metals is being redefined by major central banks worldwide. Boosted by this news, silver prices saw a remarkable single-day increase of 6.78% yesterday. Although short-term holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust have declined, commodity analysts generally believe that the upward trend in precious metals is unlikely to reverse in the short term, due to the market clearing out weak short positions and geopolitical demand for physical gold reserves.

A sudden liquidation crisis hit the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin falling below $70,000 and triggering extreme fears.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: MEXC News, Saxo Bank\n- **Summary**: According to MEXC News, the cryptocurrency market experienced its largest liquidation crisis in the past 90 days yesterday. Bitcoin (BTC) prices fluctuated wildly, quickly falling below the key $70,000 level, and market sentiment instantly turned into a state of \"extreme fear.\" The liquidation pressure mainly stemmed from Bitcoin miner selling and the ripple effect of the overall weakness in risk assets. Several Bitcoin spot ETFs, including IBIT, experienced significant outflows. Saxo Bank's analysis indicates that liquidity in the cryptocurrency market is rapidly thinning, and the collapse in short-term investor confidence could lead to high volatility for some time to come.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MEXC News](https://www.mexc.co/news/649626)\n\n### 30.

UBS predicts that, benefiting from strong direct investment and a trade surplus, the ringgit could further reach 3.80 by the end of 2026. Currently, large global funds are generally overweight in Malaysian assets, demonstrating a strong market preference.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Star](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/05/global-investors-betting-on-039rising-star039-malaysia-as-foreign-cash-piles-in)",
