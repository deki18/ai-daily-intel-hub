Federal Reserve Vice Chair Bowman proposed regulatory reforms aimed at restoring banks' position in the mortgage lending market.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Federal Reserve Board, Scotsman Guide\n- **Summary**: According to the latest news received by this station, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman delivered an important speech at the American Bankers Association conference. Bowman pointed out that since the 2008 financial crisis, traditional banks' market share in mortgage lending and advisory services has declined significantly. To address this structural change, Bowman revealed that the Federal Reserve is currently developing two specific regulations for mortgage lending, with the core objective of rebalancing the industry structure and stabilizing the cornerstone role of banks in the financial markets. Observers point out that Federal Reserve officials will be speaking frequently this week, and the market is holding its breath awaiting the release of the FOMC meeting minutes on Thursday, attempting to find the latest policy clues on how the Fed will respond to the deteriorating labor market and potential tariff inflationary pressures.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm)\n  - [2] [Scotsman Guide](https://www.scotsmanguide.com/news/bowman-signals-fed-prepared-to-revive-banks-role-in-mortgage-market/)\n\n### 2. US Treasury yields stabilized around the 4% mark, and the policy stance of incoming Chairman Walsh sparked heated discussions in the market.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: MarketMinute, Politico\n- **Summary**: Reports from Wall Street indicate that the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond is currently stable around 4.07%. Although January CPI data showed inflation cooling faster than expected, Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly emphasized the stickiness of service sector costs and the resilience of the unemployment rate at 4.4%, keeping the current interest rate range of 3.5% to 3.75% in a wait-and-see mode. According to Politico, market focus has shifted to incoming Fed Chair Kevin Warsh. Analysts believe there is a potential conflict between Warsh's potential push for quantitative easing reforms and the Trump administration's goal of lowering borrowing costs. Currently, mainstream traders have postponed their expectations for the next rate cut to June of this year.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MarketMinute](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-16-the-4-anchor-us-treasury-yields-stabilize-as-fed-signals-mid-cycle-pause)\n  - [2] [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/16/trump-wants-the-fed-to-cut-rates-kevin-warsh-has-bigger-plans-00781657)\n\n### 3. In response to a nationwide \"cent shortage,\" the Federal Reserve plans to intervene urgently in coin circulation and allocation.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: New Orleans City Business, Wicked Local\n- **Summary**: According to our report, a significant coin shortage has emerged across the United States due to the Trump administration's halt to orders for penny blanks in May 2025. The production cost of a single penny has reportedly soared to 3.69 cents, far exceeding its face value. In response, the Federal Reserve's Financial Services Department announced an emergency plan on February 16th to alleviate retailers' difficulty in making change by accepting new bank deposits and optimizing the circulation of existing inventory. Although new coin production has ceased, the Federal Reserve reiterated that the penny remains legal tender, and this intervention aims to maintain the stability of currency circulation through the role of the financial hub without increasing the fiscal burden.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [New Orleans City Business](https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2026/02/16/us-penny-shortage-production-ends-fed-circulation/)\n  - [2] [Wicked Local](https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/news/2026/02/16/penny-shortage-president-donald-trump-federal-reserve-bank-us-mint/88707935007/)\n\n### 4. Decoding the New York Fed's Open Market Operations: How the Federal Reserve \"Directs\" Market Interest Rates\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Marketplace\n- **Summary**: According to a popular science report published by Marketplace, the Federal Reserve's changes to interest rates are not arbitrary but achieved through precise open market operations by the New York Fed. Specifically, staff adjust the reserve levels within the banking system by buying and selling securities such as Treasury bonds, in accordance with the FOMC's instructions. For example, during the rate-cutting cycle at the end of 2025, the New York Fed ensured sufficient reserves in the market by increasing its holdings of Treasury bonds. This routine operation not only guides the federal funds rate within the target range but also ensures that macroeconomic policy intentions truly penetrate every corner of the market, maintaining the liquidity balance of the financial system.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2026/02/16/how-does-the-fed-actually-change-interest-rates)\n\n### 5.

China released several key economic indicators, with industrial output and GDP becoming market benchmarks.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: JPM HK Warrants\n- **Summary**: According to information obtained by our reporter from financial market scheduling, the Chinese government released a series of key industrial and economic data in mid-February. These data cover core dimensions such as monthly industrial output growth, annualized GDP growth rate, and GDP deflator. As the first batch of key data following the implementation of large-scale economic stimulus policies, this is seen as a \"thermometer\" for assessing the current strength of China's industrial production recovery and the actual driving effect of macroeconomic policies. Analysts believe that these immediate facts support the market's judgment on the state of China's macroeconomy and also provide quantitative evidence for international investors to assess the long-term potential and short-term risks of the Chinese market.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [JPM HK Warrants](https://www.jpmhkwarrants.com/en_hk/forex-warrants)\n\n### 7. A think tank report reveals challenges to China's FDI share, and fluctuations in international capital attractiveness spark heated discussions.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: BusinessMirror\n- **Summary**: According to BusinessMirror, a think tank recently challenged the Chinese Embassy's statement regarding job losses, citing data to reveal structural challenges China faces in its global investment landscape. The data shows that in 2024, China accounted for only 0.55% of global net FDI inflows, demonstrating a clear downward trend. The report points out that the attractiveness of China's industrial environment to international capital is fluctuating due to industrial transformation and multiple external pressures. This finding provides another perspective for assessing long-term industrial performance and has sparked in-depth discussions among academics and policymakers on how to optimize the investment environment and retain international capital.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [BusinessMirror](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2026/02/17/think-tank-disputes-chinese-embassy-claims-on-job-losses/)\n\n### 8. With the Eurozone's February PMI preview figures about to be released, there is still a glimmer of hope for the euro to return to the 1.20 level.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Bitget News\n- **Summary**: According to market analysis by Bitget News, the Eurozone's preliminary February Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has become the absolute core focus of the current foreign exchange market. Although the recent rise in the euro against the dollar has somewhat subsided, analysts believe that as long as the Eurozone economy demonstrates sufficient growth resilience and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut are not further reduced, the euro still has the momentum to return to the 1.20 level. The market is currently closely watching the economic performance of major European member states to assess the European Central Bank's future policy maneuvering space. In the game between inflation and growth, this week's PMI data will be the deciding factor in the euro's near-term trend.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bitget News](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605200569)\n\n### 9. The European Central Bank's liquidity supply reached €4.7 trillion, and Executive Board member Nagel supported a stablecoin for the euro.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Bitcoinworld, Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to our in-depth tracking of the European Central Bank's (ECB) liquidity structure, the bank's total liquidity supply has climbed to €4.7 trillion by 2025, while the value of its collateral pool has risen to €5.8 trillion. In their analysis, experts focused on adjustments to the collateral eligibility for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). Notably, ECB Governing Council member Nagel publicly stated his support for promoting euro-denominated stablecoins and applying them to the payment system. This signal indicates that the ECB is seeking a more modern monetary policy transmission mechanism through multiple channels, including interest rates, credit, and asset prices, to consolidate the euro's international position.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bitcoinworld](https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ecb-liquidity-structural-questions-rabobank/)\n  - [2] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com)\n\n### 10.

This date has become a key marker on global traders' calendars. As a crucial juncture for assessing the direction of the Eurozone's monetary policy in the spring, the market will be looking for clear indications about the progress of balance sheet reduction or the future path of interest rates from the official statement. With the arrival of spring, this ECB decision will have a profound impact on the liquidity of financial markets in the Eurozone and even globally.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [J.P.

Inflation expectations are driving euro exchange rate volatility, while the futures market awaits the European Central Bank's policy anchor.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Barron's\n- **Summary**: According to Barron's, data from euro futures expiring in July 2026 shows that global investors are on high alert. Analysts point out that even minor fluctuations in inflation data are now directly influencing the European Central Bank's next move and profoundly shaping the market pricing logic for the euro against the US dollar. As the unevenness of economic recovery within Europe becomes more apparent, the correlation between inflation expectations and exchange rate volatility is becoming increasingly close. Investors are currently inclined to hedge potential policy risks through futures contracts, and the upcoming series of inflation data will be a key basis for the market to repric the euro.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/futures/ecn26?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdKFh_8qh2Wx_JtUNU5Pwzv2ocZiJ7eSgai5PBHgaEBatb0dAif6YAu&gaa_ts=6993fc11&gaa_sig=IxhEVyO3ywP6AVm_tUbMcCNBzvgfUI80-63zUqb9qEc81H66apZ5g7gOlm-_Rjnc11njAWRikXkny5AP07IRKw%3D%3D)\n\n### 12.

This update is extensive, covering multiple dimensions including banking, capital markets, company law, IT architecture, and crucial data protection. The report reflects the latest developments in the EU's post-Brexit financial regulatory environment. Industry legal experts point out that these policy adjustments will directly impact the operating models of multinational investment institutions in Europe, particularly in compliance requirements regarding cross-border data transfers and capital market access, providing valuable insights into the overall European economic policy environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/newsmap.xml)\n\n### 13. Japan's fourth-quarter GDP growth was sluggish; Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi met with Kazuo Ueda to discuss countermeasures.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Reuters, CNBC\n- **Summary**: According to Reuters and CNBC, the latest official Japanese data shows that Japan's GDP annualized growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2025 will be only 0.2%, far below the market expectation of 1.6%. While narrowly avoiding a technical recession, the sluggish consumer growth (only 0.1%) has raised concerns about the momentum of the Japanese economy, causing the yen to fall to around 153 against the dollar. On the same day, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda held their first meeting since the general election. Although Ueda stated that the Prime Minister did not put forward specific policy requests, analysts generally believe that given the fragile economic recovery and Takaichi's dovish stance, the Bank of Japan's planned spring interest rate hike may be postponed.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-economy-barely-grew-q4-misses-forecasts-2026-02-16/)\n  - [2] [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/japan-fourth-quarter-gdp-reverses-into-growth-but-misses-expectations-as-rebound-underwhelms.html)\n\n### 14. Former foreign exchange chief Takehiko Nakao strongly supports a gradual interest rate hike aimed at curbing excessive depreciation of the yen.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to Bloomberg, Takehiko Nakao, former head of foreign exchange affairs at Japan's Ministry of Finance, publicly called for the Bank of Japan to implement a \"steady and gradual\" interest rate hike in an interview. Nakao pointed out that the continued weakening of the yen has already negatively impacted national purchasing power. He believes that a moderate interest rate increase would not only effectively address current inflationary pressures but is also a necessary means to curb excessive yen depreciation and stabilize long-term government bond yields. Nakao's remarks have sparked heated debate in financial circles, seen as a veteran official's public assessment of the Bank of Japan's current policy resolve, reflecting intense internal discussions in Japan about how to balance exchange rate stability and economic growth.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-16/japan-s-ex-fx-chief-says-rate-hike-needed-for-stable-market)\n\n### 15. Multiple institutions have raised their economic forecasts for India, with GDP growth expected to remain at 7.4% in FY26.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: LiveMint, IMF\n- **Summary**: According to reports from Indian media outlets such as LiveMint, several authoritative international institutions have recently raised their economic growth forecasts for India in fiscal year 2025-26. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) significantly increased its forecast from 6.6% to 7.3% on Monday, while India's National Statistical Office maintained its high growth expectation of 7.4%. The report points out that a robust 9.1% growth in the service sector and expansion of fixed asset investment are the core drivers. Despite global trade uncertainties, India's strong domestic consumption and structural reform dividends have made it widely recognized as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. The Reserve Bank of India has also expressed strong confidence in the resilience of domestic demand.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [LiveMint](https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-gdp-forecast-fy26-global-uncertainties-rbi-adb-fitch-advance-estimate-reforms-11767770541335.html)\n  - [2] [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/imf-raises-fy26-growth-forecast-to-7-3-from-6-6/articleshow/126718682.cms)\n\n### 16. Indian financial markets experienced volatility, with a $3 billion outflow of foreign capital putting pressure on the rupee.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: LiveMint, MacroMicro\n- **Summary**: According to our observations, as of February 17th, the Indian stock market exhibited significant volatility despite strong growth forecasts. The SENSEX 30 index is currently at 83,277 points. Analysis shows that foreign capital liquidity has faced temporary pressure due to the derivatives tax increase in the 2026 budget, with a net outflow of over $3 billion in foreign capital since the beginning of the year. The rupee exchange rate is also hovering around the 90 mark against the backdrop of a strengthening US dollar. Although inflows from domestic institutional investors have mitigated some downside risks, the IT sector has performed relatively weakly, impacted by slowing global spending and the technological revolution brought about by artificial intelligence. The future of foreign capital is becoming the biggest variable in the Indian financial market in the short term.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [LiveMint](https://www.livemint.com/)\n  - [2] [MacroMicro](https://en.macromicro.me/trader-insights)\n\n### 17. Global bond yields climb to high levels; Sweden actively considers joining the Eurozone.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, Bitget\n- **Summary**: According to our comprehensive monitoring, global sovereign bond yields remained high over the past 24 hours. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 4.036%, while the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 2.158%. Of particular note is Sweden's shift towards joining the euro due to security concerns and krona volatility, signaling a potential major change in the Nordic monetary landscape. Furthermore, the Philippine central bank is expected to consider an interest rate cut on February 19th due to weak fourth-quarter economic growth and stabilizing inflation. A former official from the People's Bank of China warned that global military spending, government debt, and interest rate fluctuations remain major risks to financial markets, and signs of tightening liquidity should not be ignored.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/crude-oil)\n  - [2] [Business Mirror](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2026/02/16/security-fears-push-sweden-to-warm-up-to-the-euro-after-2-decades-of-resistance/)\n\n### 18. Gold prices fell below the $5,000 mark, while the Iranian Straits exercises supported crude oil bulls.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-17\n- **Source**: Investing.com, Bitget, SCMP\n- **Summary**: According to the latest market data received by this station, the global commodity market is experiencing significant volatility. Spot gold prices briefly fell below the $5,000 mark, reaching $4,998 per ounce, due to the liquidation of leveraged positions. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions escalated again, with Iran's live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz providing strong support for crude oil bulls. In the foreign exchange market, the strengthening of the Malaysian ringgit is squeezing the profits of Malaysian exporters. Furthermore, China's progress in de-dollarization has pushed the yuan's central parity rate to its highest level in recent years, and it has made new progress in reducing logistics costs. The Philippine government announced that, after successfully controlling inflation, it is shifting its economic focus to a sustainable growth path.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/indices/sensex-historical-data)\n  - [2] [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/amp/news/detail/12560605202825)\n  - [3] [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy)\n\n### 19. The US January non-farm payroll data showed an overheated market, while downward revisions to historical data revealed underlying concerns in the job market.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-11\n- **Source**: SHRM, Reuters, BLS\n- **Summary**: According to our station, the latest data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Reuters shows that U.S. non-farm payrolls unexpectedly increased by 130,000 in January, far exceeding the market expectation of 70,000. While this data superficially demonstrates the resilience of the labor market, leading to a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, the underlying crisis should not be underestimated. Reports indicate that the official figures significantly revised the full-year employment growth forecast for 2025, lowering it by a substantial 862,000. This means that economic growth momentum over the past year was far weaker than previously described. This contradictory situation of \"strong data, weak base\" has led the market to deeply question the true health of the U.S. job market, and the dollar exchange rate has fluctuated due to the inflated figures.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)\n  - [2] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-employment-growth-through-march-revised-down-by-862000-jobs-2026-02-11/)\n\n### 20. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in January, and former Fed officials predict three rate cuts in the first half of the year.\n- **Time**: 2026-01-28\n- **Source**: Federal Reserve Board, MNI\n- **Summary**: According to the official statement released by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided at its meeting at the end of January to maintain the existing benchmark interest rate range at 3.5% to 3.75%. Despite strong January employment data, policymakers chose to remain on hold. According to an analysis by former Philadelphia Fed official Tilley cited by MNI, the Fed's stance may undergo a significant shift in the coming months as the labor market shows signs of deterioration after historical corrections. Tilley predicts that the Fed may cut interest rates three times consecutively in the first half of 2026 to address potential growth slowdown. Other observers believe that the current downward trend in inflation is providing the Fed with the necessary room to begin a rate-cutting cycle, and market focus has shifted entirely to the interest rate path before summer.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260128a.htm)\n  - [2] [MNI](https://media.marketnews.com/US_Employment_Report_Feb2026_781838d85a.pdf)\n\n### 21. Analysis warns that the US may be entering a period of mild stagflation, with the unemployment rate projected to rise further to 4.5%.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-12\n- **Source**: TimeTrex\n- **Summary**: According to TimeTrex's 2026 Labor Market Report, the US economy faces the risk of entering a phase of \"mild stagflation.\" The report analyzes that although employment data has rebounded in the short term, structural contradictions are becoming increasingly prominent. It predicts that the unemployment rate will inevitably rise from its current low to the 4.4% to 4.5% range in the coming quarters. Investigative reporters found that the coexistence of sticky wage growth and weak labor force participation rates, coupled with low growth and inflationary pressures, is limiting companies' willingness to hire. The report reminds investors that due to the significantly reduced base of the 2025 employment data, economic growth expectations for 2026 need to be reassessed, and the cooling process in the labor market may be more painful than the market anticipates.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [TimeTrex](https://www.timetrex.com/blog/2026-us-labor-market-report)\n\n### 22. With January CPI data about to be released, sticky inflation may become the biggest obstacle to interest rate cuts.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-12\n- **Source**: Forex.com\n- **Summary**: According to a market preview published by Forex.com, investors are holding their breath awaiting the upcoming release of the January Consumer Price Index (CPI). The market currently widely predicts that the year-on-year CPI increase in January will remain around 2.5%. The report points out that although overall price levels have declined somewhat, \"sticky inflation\" in core service sectors remains strong, which could be a major obstacle for the Federal Reserve in achieving its inflation target. Analysts warn that if inflation data fails to cool as expected, even with a weak job market, the Federal Reserve may be more cautious in its interest rate cuts, and may even postpone the policy shift until the second half of the year. This uncertainty is causing significant volatility in the current foreign exchange and bond markets.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Forex.com](https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/us-cpi-preview-sticky-inflation-to-keep-the-fed-on-hold-until-the-summer/)\n\n### 23. India unveils its 2026 federal budget, with infrastructure investment and fiscal consolidation as key focuses.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-01\n- **Source**: Upstox\n- **Summary**: According to reports from our overseas bureaus, the Indian government, one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, recently officially released its 2026 federal budget. Upstox analysis shows that the new budget continues the Modi government's strong emphasis on infrastructure development and attempts to strike a balance between stimulating growth and maintaining fiscal discipline. Following the budget's release, both the Indian SENSEX and Nifty 50 indices showed significant reactions. The financial community generally believes that the incentives for manufacturing and continued investment in digital transformation mentioned in the budget will further attract global capital inflows to India. However, analysts also point out that India's ability to withstand currency depreciation pressures in the complex global financial environment will still depend on the successful implementation of its fiscal deficit targets in the budget.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Upstox](https://upstox.com/news/market-news/trading/stock-market-nifty-50-sensex-live-updates-on-sunday-february-1-union-budget-2026/liveblog-188661/)",
