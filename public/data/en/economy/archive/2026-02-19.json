In response, an ECB spokesperson quickly stated that Lagarde is currently fully focused on her mission and has not yet made any decisions regarding her term. Market analysts suggest that at this delicate juncture when Eurozone inflation is nearing the 2% target, a change in the ECB president's appointment will introduce new uncertainties into monetary policy.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2026/02/18/ecb-president-lagarde-plans-to-quit-before-macron039s-term-ends-ft-reports)\n  - [2] [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/ecb-hoses-down-speculation-about-lagardes-future/)\n\n### 9.

Faced with rising Japanese bond yields and pressure on the yen's depreciation, her policy rhetoric became more cautious, emphasizing \"responsible fiscal policy\" to win market confidence.
