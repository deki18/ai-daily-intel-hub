Furthermore, this description echoes the central bank's subsequent adjustments to interest rates and expectations, providing empirical evidence for policy formulation.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-dips-growth-holds-up-backing-ecbs-sanguine-narrative-2026-01-06/)\n\n### 12.

The report points out that this divergence makes it difficult for the central bank to make a judgment—weak short-term demand could suppress prices, but if inflation expectations become sticky, it poses a risk to medium-term price stability. The report indicates that the central bank is closely monitoring changes in the labor market and inflation expectations to determine its future policy path.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/ecb-says-consumers-inflation-expectations-remain-unchanged)\n\n### 15.

The report cited economists who stated that this data dampened the need for further short-term interest rate hikes, but also suggested that underlying price pressures had not completely disappeared. It is also observed that central banks face a choice in interpreting this data: whether to wait for more evidence to confirm a decline in inflation, or to remain vigilant about potential service sector inflation and latent inflation signals.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/euro-zone-inflation-january-ecb-disinflation-concerns.html)\n\n### 16.

Studies show that US tariffs may suppress inflation in the Eurozone, but interest rate cuts could offset the effect.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: Reuters\n- **Summary**: According to a Reuters report on February 10th, an analysis by European Central Bank economists stated that US tariffs on certain goods could exert downward pressure on Eurozone inflation through the demand channel. The report further pointed out that sectors affected by tariffs are typically more sensitive to interest rates, and if the central bank chooses to cut interest rates in the future, the effect could partially offset the downward pressure on inflation caused by tariffs. The report indicates that this research provides policymakers with a new perspective on weighing interest rate paths when facing external shocks.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-take-hit-tariffs-rate-cuts-could-offset-ecb-economists-find-2026-02-10/)\n\n### 18.

However, the report points out that without deeper institutional reforms—such as a banking union and co-borrowing facilities—further unification of spreads will remain difficult. The report also mentions that the market widely expects central banks to begin cutting interest rates later this year, an expectation already priced into current bond prices and spreads.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ultra-low-bond-spread-unity-still-out-reach-euro-area-2026-02-04/)\n\n### 19.

The report points out that rising long-term inflation expectations could increase the challenges for central banks in achieving medium-term price stability, as rising expectations can affect wage negotiations and pricing behavior. The report indicates that regulators and monetary authorities will continue to monitor this indicator to prevent inflation expectations from becoming chronic and negatively impacting policy effectiveness.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/euro-zone-consumers-up-5-year-inflation-forecast-record-high-ecb-poll-shows-2026-01-30/)\n\n### 20.
