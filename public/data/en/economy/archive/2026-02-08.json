The Federal Reserve maintained the upper limit of its benchmark interest rate at 3.75% to ensure monetary policy stability.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: FRED (St. Louis Fed)\n- **Summary**: According to our report, official data updated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) on February 8, 2026, shows that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors decided to maintain the upper limit of the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.75%. The report indicates that this rate level has remained unchanged since early February, fully reflecting the Federal Open Market Committee's consistent stance of seeking to maintain monetary policy stability following its recent meetings. Observers point out that in the current macroeconomic environment, the Fed's move aims to provide the market with clear policy expectations, addressing potential economic volatility and ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial system by maintaining the existing interest rate framework.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [FRED (St. Louis Fed)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)\n\n### 2. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Operations Transformation: From Reducing Securities Holdings to Gradually Increasing Holdings\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: BPInsights\n- **Summary**: A recent analysis by BP Insights indicates a significant shift in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy operations. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee noted that the Fed has begun shifting from a strategy of reducing its securities holdings to one of gradual accumulation. Simultaneously, to enhance liquidity in financial markets, the Fed is expected to increase the frequency of its standing repurchase operations. This policy shift is seen as a proactive measure to address potential market volatility, demonstrating the complex considerations of monetary authorities between balancing the balance sheet and maintaining market stability. This station will continue to monitor the profound impact of this operation on the global liquidity environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [BPInsights](https://bpi.com/bpinsights-february-7-2026/)\n\n### 3. Rothschild & Co. warns: Political pressure could erode the Federal Reserve's independence.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Rothschild & Co\n- **Summary**: Rothschild & Co. issued a stern warning in its latest report. According to their analysis, although the financial markets have reacted relatively mildly to the political pressure facing the Federal Reserve, the lurking risks cannot be ignored. The report emphasizes that damage to the Fed's independence could directly lead to a loss of credibility, thereby triggering widespread financial instability. Rothschild experts advise investors to be wary of the possibility of external political interference in decision-making transparency, as this not only concerns short-term interest rate trends but also the long-term credit foundation of the US dollar in the global financial system.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Rothschild & Co](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beyond-noise-february-2026-rothschildandco-pmmae)\n\n### 4. Commercial banks are expected to increase their holdings of US Treasury bonds in response to regulatory changes and deposit growth.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to Bloomberg, global commercial banks are preparing to expand their investments in U.S. Treasury bonds amid changing regulatory environments and widespread market expectations for deposit growth. This move is seen as a defensive strategy by the banking sector in the context of persistently high interest rates. Analysts point out that this action by banking institutions is not only to meet capital adequacy requirements but also an important means of seeking stable returns in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. Market observers generally believe that this large-scale capital flow may flatten the U.S. Treasury yield curve and further alter the asset allocation structure of the private sector.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-07/get-ready-for-double-whammy-of-us-jobs-and-inflation)\n\n### 5. Market defensive sentiment is rising: Funds are rotating more rapidly into the consumer staples sector.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Investing.com\n- **Summary**: According to analysts at Investing.com, the macroeconomic environment at the beginning of 2026 remains highly uncertain, leading to a significant increase in the defensive stance of global investors. The latest fund flow data shows a large amount of capital rotating from high-risk assets to defensive sectors such as consumer staples. Analyst Charles-Henry Monchau emphasizes that this trend reflects the market's extreme pursuit of stable returns, especially given the current persistently high interest rates and unclear economic indicators. Investors generally hope to hedge against potential sharp economic fluctuations by allocating assets with counter-cyclical characteristics.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/)\n\n### 6.

As head of the cabinet, Takaichi's policy proposals are considered to have a profound impact on the independence of the Bank of Japan. Reports indicate that the market is closely watching her latest statements regarding inflation targets and fiscal policy. With changing global inflationary pressures, whether Takaichi will push Japan to end its long-term ultra-loose monetary environment or intervene in yen exchange rate fluctuations has become a key indicator for global investors to judge the future direction of Japan's monetary policy. Currently, the Tokyo financial market is on high alert.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Japan Today](https://japantoday.com/sitemap.xml)\n\n### 7.

In Hyderabad, gasoline prices remained at 107.45 rupees per liter; while diesel prices in Janshepur and Vadodara remained at 92.53 rupees and 89.82 rupees respectively. Data shows that fuel prices in these regions have remained unchanged over the past 10 days. This indicates that despite fluctuations in the international crude oil market, the domestic retail market for refined petroleum products in India has remained relatively stable during the current monitoring period.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/fuel-price/telangana/petrol-price-in-hyderabad/)\n\n### 8. Gold prices break through the $5,000 mark and hit a new all-time high.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to real-time monitoring by Trading Economics, the global commodities market has witnessed a historic moment, with gold prices successfully breaking through the $5,000 per ounce mark, setting a new all-time high. Reports indicate that this surge is primarily driven by rising global risk aversion and concerns about sovereign credit. Analysts point out that investors are flocking to the gold market at an unprecedented pace, viewing it as a last line of defense against geopolitical pressures and currency devaluation risks. With this key psychological price level breached, the market is closely watching whether gold prices will trigger even larger inflows of safe-haven funds.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)\n\n### 9. Silver prices have risen by 145% this year and have remained volatile at high levels.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: CBS News\n- **Summary**: According to CBS News, the silver market continued its active trading over the past 24 hours, currently holding above $77.97 per ounce. Despite entering a period of consolidation after its earlier surge, its approximately 145% increase compared to the same period last year still astonishes the market. Analysis indicates that silver's dual attributes as both an industrial raw material and a safe-haven asset are being fully realized against the backdrop of increasing technology spending and global geopolitical pressures. Currently, the volatility of the silver market remains significantly higher than that of gold, and investors are cautiously assessing its future price potential.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CBS News](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)\n\n### 10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 points for the first time in history.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Economic Times\n- **Summary**: According to the Economic Times, driven by increased spending in the AI industry and a strong rebound in tech stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 points for the first time on February 8, 2026, marking a new era for the US stock market. Despite numerous uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, the performance of tech leaders continued to support investor confidence. Analysts point out that due to continued global investment in artificial intelligence, the expected returns for related industries have significantly improved. However, some experts caution that after the index reached this key milestone, potential profit-taking pressure should be anticipated in the short term.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Economic Times](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)\n\n### 11. The global crude oil market maintained a wide range of fluctuations.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest data released by Trading Economics, the global energy market remained volatile over the past 24 hours. As of February 8, 2026, WTI crude oil futures were trading at $63.55 per barrel, while Brent crude oil was trading at $68.05 per barrel. The report indicates that oil prices are currently influenced by multiple factors, including expectations of a global economic slowdown and concerns about potential tariff threats. Analysts believe that the delicate balance between supply and demand, along with fluctuations in geopolitical risks, makes it difficult for oil prices to achieve a significant unilateral breakout in the short term, and the market is currently in a waiting period to see the next moves of major oil-producing countries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)\n\n### 12.

She pointed out that emerging markets now account for more than 56% of global GDP, undeniably becoming the main driver of global economic growth. Georgieva emphasized that this rise of emerging economies is reshaping the global economic landscape, but also faces unprecedented challenges. She called on countries to further strengthen policy coordination to address the increasingly complex global trade environment and financial market volatility. This statement underscores the IMF's expectation for emerging markets to play a greater role in global governance.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2632181/business-economy)\n\n### 13.

First, she emphasized unleashing the potential of the private sector by reducing administrative intervention, deepening financial markets, and strengthening institutional governance; second, she stressed the importance of strengthening regional integration to address changes in the global trade landscape. She believes that the dynamism of the private sector is key to sustainable growth for emerging economies. Analysts point out that this recommendation provides a clear roadmap for emerging markets facing pressure for structural reforms, highlighting the importance of internal reforms and regional cooperation in addressing global uncertainty.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2632181/business-economy)\n\n### 14. Expectations of interest rate cuts may lead to a return of capital to emerging market assets.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Bitget\n- **Summary**: A market analysis report released by Bitget points out that as market expectations for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve gradually intensify, the strong position of the US dollar may face challenges. Against this backdrop, the attractiveness of emerging market assets is expected to increase significantly, thereby attracting a renewed inflow of global capital. The report also indicates that despite the optimistic outlook, experts warn that emerging markets must be wary of capital outflow risks due to exchange rate volatility and changes in global risk sentiment. Analysts believe that emerging economies need to build more resilient financial systems to cope with the sharp capital fluctuations resulting from the shift in interest rate policies in developed countries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/wiki/how-interest-rate-cuts-affect-stock-market)\n\n### 15. India opens up direct equity investment to global investors for the first time\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: The Banking Updates\n- **Summary**: According to our report, the Indian government recently announced a landmark policy, opening its equity market to global investors for the first time, allowing foreigners to directly invest in stocks. This move aims to significantly boost foreign investment inflows and further deepen India's capital markets. The report indicates that this is seen as a key step in attracting long-term global capital in the Indian government's efforts to modernize its economy. The market has reacted enthusiastically, widely believing that this will greatly enhance the international participation of the Indian stock market and provide local companies with more diversified financing channels. Our station will closely monitor the specific implementation details of this policy.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Banking Updates](https://thebankingupdates.com/)\n\n### 16. Indian stock market rebounds strongly after tax policy changes trigger sharp fluctuations.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Partystar.be\n- **Summary**: According to Partystar.be, the Indian capital market recently experienced a period of intense volatility. Influenced by the proposed increase in the futures and options (F&O) securities transaction tax in the 2026-27 budget, the Indian stock market initially fell by 2% on Sunday. However, after the policy uncertainty eased slightly, the Sensex index subsequently rebounded strongly by 942 points. Analysts point out that this phenomenon reflects a fierce battle between bulls and bears in the capital market under the influence of the new policy. Despite the short-term impact of the tax policy adjustment, market confidence in India's long-term economic growth remains remarkably resilient.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Partystar.be](https://partystar.be/6empd8lpc9uqs8)\n\n### 17. The 10-year US Treasury yield touched 4.22%, reflecting fiscal concerns.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest bond market monitoring data released by Trading Economics, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 4.22% on February 6, an increase of 0.03 percentage points from the previous trading day. This significant rebound reflects investors' growing concerns about the U.S. government's fiscal deficit and future policy uncertainty. Analysis indicates that the bond market is in a sensitive period, with investors rebuilding term premiums, leading to a further steepening of the yield curve. This upward pressure on yields is becoming more pronounced as the synchronized interest rate cut cycle in developed economies ends, and the market begins to reassess the cost of holding long-term debt.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield)\n\n### 18. A hawkish report from the German central bank led to a general rise in global government bond yields.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Reuters\n- **Summary**: According to a hawkish report released by the German Federal Bank on February 6, cited by Reuters, the global government bond market is facing a new wave of upward pressure on yields. The report's strong stance on inflation risks directly led to a collective rise in bond yields in countries such as the UK, Japan, and Canada. Currently, UK government bond yields have reached 4.51%, Japanese yields have risen to 2.23%, and Canadian yields are at 3.41%. Observers point out that as fiscal expansion (such as Germany's increased defense infrastructure spending) gradually replaces monetary policy as the dominant factor in market volatility, the global bond market is undergoing a profound adjustment driven by fiscal policy, and investors need to be wary of the resulting valuation pressures.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Reuters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsGWVpyHp4w)\n\n### 19. Analysts warn that US fiscal pressures could trigger sovereign default risks.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Pun Salad\n- **Summary**: A deep analysis report published by Pun Salad warns that the United States' ever-increasing debt and fiscal pressures are pushing the entire financial system to the brink. If the political gridlock continues to hinder key fiscal reforms, a complete loss of public confidence could lead to a sudden and sharp depreciation of the dollar – a \"currency crisis.\" The report powerfully points out that policymakers may be forced to confront explicit or implicit debt defaults, including failure to make timely debt payments or mandatory restructuring. The long-term damage from this loss of fiscal flexibility could far exceed the impact on living standards of any previous acute crisis.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Pun Salad](https://punsalad.com/)\n\n### 20. Expectations of fiscal stimulus from Japan's new cabinet have steepened the yield curve for government bonds.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Bloomberg (MLIV)\n- **Summary**: According to a recent analysis by Bloomberg (MLIV), Japanese government bond yields have risen significantly recently due to the potential implementation of a large-scale fiscal stimulus plan by the new Japanese cabinet. The market widely expects the new government's expansionary fiscal policy to increase government financing needs, thereby further steepening the yield curve. Currently, the 10-year Japanese government bond yield has risen to 2.23%. Analysts believe this trend reflects Japan's shift from long-term monetary easing to a fiscally driven policy. Given the high degree of interconnectedness in global markets, this unusual movement in the Japanese bond market has also triggered a reassessment of safe-haven and arbitrage positions by international capital. This station will continue to monitor its developments.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bloomberg (MLIV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6bcuytZis8)",
