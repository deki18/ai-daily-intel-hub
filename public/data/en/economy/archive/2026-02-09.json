In today's program, we will provide an in-depth analysis of 20 major events impacting global processes: from the \"fiscal agreement\" concept that sparked heated debate within the Federal Reserve, to the historic stock market breakthrough triggered by the political upheaval in Japan; from the massive liquidity release before the Chinese New Year, to the significant announcement of the planned mutual visits between the leaders of China and the United States. The global financial markets are currently at a crossroads of multiple forces, and this report will provide you with detailed background information and in-depth insights. Let's dive right into today's core news roundup.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. With the Federal Reserve keeping policy rates high, the market is focused on Warsh's \"Fed-Treasury agreement\" concept.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: FRED, Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to our report, as of February 9, 2026, the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target rate for the federal funds rate will remain at 3.75%. Although inflation expectations have been revised downwards in a University of Michigan survey, the US Treasury yield curve showed a slight flattening trend on February 8. Currently, the market is most focused on the new proposal put forward by Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee for the next Federal Reserve Chairman. According to Bloomberg, Warsh proposed establishing a so-called \"Federal Reserve-Treasury Agreement,\" a concept that has sparked heated debate in the market. Investors worry that this move may imply that the Federal Reserve will have to indirectly support fiscal expansion by purchasing Treasury bonds in the future. Affected by this expectation, the spread between 2-year and 10-year US Treasury yields is currently still at a four-year high of approximately 69 to 74 basis points. Reports indicate that the global bond market is holding its breath awaiting the upcoming non-farm payroll and CPI data for clearer interest rate guidance.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)\n  - [2] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-08/warsh-call-for-fed-treasury-accord-stirs-debate-bond-market)\n\n### 2. The People's Bank of China injected a large amount of capital ahead of the Spring Festival, conducting 60 billion yuan of reverse repos in a single day to ease liquidity.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: RTHK, Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: To address the strong cash demand and government bond issuance pressures during the Chinese Lunar New Year, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) officially took action on February 9th. According to our observation, the central bank conducted 60 billion yuan in 14-day reverse repurchase operations today. Analysts predict that the total injection before the Spring Festival could reach a staggering 3.5 trillion yuan. Boosted by expectations of ample liquidity, the yield on China's 10-year government bonds has fallen to around 1.8%, a new low in nearly two weeks. Meanwhile, the capital market is active, with the Hang Seng Index and mainland stocks both showing significant gains. According to RTHK, although the offshore yuan remains high at around 6.93, investors are optimistic about the central bank's support measures at this crucial moment, providing a solid guarantee for the smooth operation of the financial market before the holiday.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [RTHK](https://gbcode.rthk.hk/TuniS/news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1843171-20260209.htm)\n  - [2] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/government-bond-yield/news/524090)\n\n### 3. US-China relations are entering a crucial window of opportunity as Trump announces plans for reciprocal visits between the two leaders.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Mehr News Agency\n- **Summary**: Amidst ongoing global trade frictions, the high-level interactions between China and the US have delivered a rare positive signal. According to a report by Mehr News Agency citing an interview with Trump broadcast on February 9th, Trump explicitly stated that he expects to host Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the White House at the end of 2026. Prior to this, Trump himself plans to visit China in April of this year. Although the US government has implemented numerous tariff policies targeting industries such as steel and automobiles over the past year, the disclosure of this high-level visit is seen by the market as an important attempt by both sides to ease frictions and restore trade balance. It is widely believed that, given the deep intertwining of the world's two largest economies in the industrial chain, this meeting will be one of the most influential events on the geopolitical stage in 2026.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Mehr News Agency](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/241551/Trump-says-China-s-Xi-to-visit-US-toward-the-end-of-year)\n\n### 4. Saxo Bank issued an aggressive forecast: Beijing may launch a 50 trillion yuan fiscal stimulus to reshape growth.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Saxo Bank\n- **Summary**: According to a recent market outlook report released by Saxo Bank, analysts have made extremely bold predictions about the future reflation path of the Chinese economy. The report suggests that in order to completely deflate the current debt bubble and reshape growth drivers, Beijing may unleash a fiscal stimulus package of up to 50 trillion yuan in 2026. Furthermore, Saxo Bank points out that China is accelerating the internationalization of its \"golden dollar,\" aiming to challenge the dominance of the US dollar in the long term. The report also notes the impact of cutting-edge technologies such as quantum computing on the global financial system. This extremely optimistic and unprecedented prediction has sparked widespread discussion in the investment banking community, reflecting the market's high level of concern about how China will address its current high leverage problem.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Bank](https://www.home.saxo/en-ch/content/articles/macro/market-quick-take---9-february-2026-09022026)\n\n### 5. The ECB's interest rate meeting concluded, maintaining the current policy unchanged.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Woodspartners\n- **Summary**: The European Central Bank (ECB) announced at its latest policy meeting that it would maintain the current interest rate level in the Eurozone, a decision fully in line with market expectations. According to a report by Woodspartners, ECB officials believe that despite potential pressure from global trade tensions and external tariffs, the Eurozone inflation rate has successfully approached its 2% target, and the inflation outlook is currently stable. The ECB president emphasized in the statement that the Eurozone economy has demonstrated strong resilience, and that future policy decisions will continue to be made \"data-driven and on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\" Currently, the ECB faces no urgent pressure to adjust interest rates, and its overall monetary policy will remain prudent and cautious.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Woodspartners](https://woodspartners.ie/2026/02/08/ecb-holds-interest-rates-steady-as-inflation-outlook-remains-intact/)\n\n### 6. Sanae Takaichi wins the Japanese general election, and the Liberal Democratic Party gains an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: The Guardian, Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: A major political shift occurred in Japan today. According to a joint report by The Guardian and Bloomberg, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Sanae Takaichi, won a landslide victory in the February 9th House of Representatives election, securing an absolute majority of more than two-thirds of the seats. This result marks a temporary end to political uncertainty in Japan. Although Takaichi has consistently advocated for expansionary fiscal policies, which could push up Japan's already high debt levels, the market reacted positively. The stabilization of the political situation has reassured investors, and risk aversion has subsided somewhat. However, Japanese government bond yields rose across the board after the election results were announced, reflecting market expectations of potentially greater fiscal expansion and rising inflationary pressures in the future.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2026/feb/09/japan-election-nikkei-record-high-yen-strengthens-takaichi-election-win-keir-starmer-pound-bonds-news-updates)\n  - [2] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2026-japan-election-results/)\n\n### 7. The Nikkei index surged 5% to break through 57,000 points for the first time, setting a new all-time record.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: MEXC, Saxo Bank\n- **Summary**: Driven directly by positive news from the Japanese election, the Japanese stock market experienced a \"highlight moment\" on February 9th. According to MEXC and related market monitoring, the Nikkei 225 index surged over 5% intraday, historically surpassing the 57,000-point mark for the first time. Reports indicate a rebound in investor risk appetite, with short positions previously established due to concerns about political upheaval being liquidated. Although the long-term bond market faces pressure due to expectations of expansionary fiscal policy, this strong performance in the stock market reflects market expectations for the continuity of Japanese economic policy. Against the backdrop of relatively sluggish global markets, the Tokyo stock market's performance made it the leader of Asian financial markets today.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [MEXC](https://www.mexc.co/news/669314)\n  - [2] [Saxo Bank](https://www.home.saxo/en-mena/content/articles/commodities/cot-on-forex-and-commodities---week-to-3-february-2026-09022026)\n\n### 8. The yen exchange rate fluctuated wildly, with the dollar falling below the 156 yen level.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Trading Economics, XE.com\n- **Summary**: The foreign exchange market was also stirred by the Japanese election results. According to XE.com's real-time monitoring, the yen strengthened today, with the USD/JPY pair falling to around 155.79, a drop of nearly 0.9%. Data from Trading Economics also confirms that the yen has appreciated by 1.48% over the past month. Although the yen has been under pressure overall over the past year, today's gains are significant. Analysts suggest this is mainly due to profit-taking by large amounts of carry trader funds that had previously shorted the yen, coupled with some global safe-haven funds flowing into Japanese bonds. However, the market remains cautious about whether the yen will fall back to the 160 level and is closely watching whether the Japanese Ministry of Finance will intervene.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/currency)\n  - [2] [XE.com](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=JPY&To=USD)\n\n### 9. The Saudi-led EU summit was held, and the IMF discussed solutions for \"resetting\" the international financial system.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: IMF, AlUla Conference Official\n- **Summary**: From February 8th to 9th, the historic Saudi Arabian city of Eula hosted senior global officials and leading economists. According to official sources from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the \"Eula Meeting on Emerging Market Economies,\" jointly hosted by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and the IMF, focused on the \"resetting\" of the international trade and financial system. The meeting reportedly emphasized how emerging economies can reposition themselves amidst global changes to address increasingly complex trade frictions and the risks of currency decoupling. This meeting is seen as a significant gathering of emerging market countries seeking greater influence in global governance, and its outcomes could have a profound impact on the future international financial order.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [IMF](https://www.imf.org/)\n  - [2] [AlUla Conference Official](https://alulaeme.com/)\n\n### 10. India releases its 2026 federal budget, with capital expenditures reaching a record 12.2 trillion rupees.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Deccan Herald, Outlook Business\n- **Summary**: According to our correspondent in New Delhi, the Indian Ministry of Finance officially released its fiscal year 2026 budget on the evening of February 8th. This budget demonstrates the Indian government's ambition to boost the economy, with total capital expenditure planned at 12.2 trillion rupees, representing 4.4% of GDP. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman emphasized in her speech that this funding will be primarily invested in infrastructure and regional connectivity. According to Deccan Herald, despite recent foreign capital outflows due to a stronger dollar and Federal Reserve policies, the Indian government hopes to attract more long-term institutional capital by establishing a 25 billion rupee infrastructure risk guarantee fund to maintain debt sustainability and hedge against the risk of rupee depreciation.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Outlook Business](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/budget/budget-2026-updates-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-speech-february-1-tax-changes-market-reaction-sector-impact)\n  - [2] [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n\n### 11. India's ambition to become a global medical hub and the India-US trade agreement boost market confidence.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Deccan Herald\n- **Summary**: Besides infrastructure investment, another major highlight of India's 2026 budget is structural reforms in the healthcare sector. The Indian government reportedly plans to increase funding for the \"SHAKTI Scheme\" to strengthen investment in digital health initiatives, transforming India into a global hub for medical tourism and pharmaceutical R&D. Notably, the Indian capital markets remain robust, boosted by the recent significant positive development of the India-US trade agreement. While officials advise investors to focus on after-tax returns under inflation, this agreement is seen as significantly expanding access for Indian goods to the US market and driving substantial cross-border investment in the medical technology sector.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n\n### 12. Commodity market sentiment collapsed, with natural gas and silver prices experiencing double-digit declines.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Saxo Bank\n- **Summary**: The commodities market is undergoing a \"bloodbath.\" According to Saxo Bank's latest Commitment of Traders (COT) report, the Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index fell 3% over the past week, indicating a dramatic shift in market sentiment. Energy and precious metals were hit hardest, with natural gas prices plunging 13.3%, silver falling by a staggering 21.4%, and platinum recording a deep correction of 12.9%. Analysts suggest that as risk aversion dissipates and management funds accelerate deleveraging, net long positions in gold have fallen to their lowest point since October of last year. This across-the-board pullback indicates that after the geopolitical premium subsided, the market is beginning to re-examine the true supply and demand fundamentals of commodities.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Bank](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/commodities/cot-on-forex-and-commodities---week-to-3-february-2026-09022026)\n\n### 13. Short positions in the US dollar have doubled in the foreign exchange market, with speculative positions hitting a six-month high.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Saxo Group\n- **Summary**: According to a liquidity analysis briefing released by Saxo Bank, despite recent signs of a US dollar rebound, speculative positions in the global foreign exchange market present a starkly contrasting picture. Data shows that total short positions in the US dollar across eight major currency futures have more than doubled to $17.4 billion, a six-month high. Meanwhile, long positions in the euro and Canadian dollar are currently at their highest levels since the summer of 2023. This massive contrarian betting reflects a widespread bet by speculative institutions that the Federal Reserve will make a significant shift in the second half of the year, and also foreshadows a potential large-scale short squeeze risk in the foreign exchange market should the dollar's fundamentals unexpectedly strengthen.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Group](https://www.home.saxo/en-ch/learn/guides/equities/magnificent-7-stocks-what-they-are-and-why-you-should-care)\n\n### 14. A dramatic shift in international oil trade flows: India reduces its purchases of Russian oil and shifts its focus to West Africa.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Geopolitics Unplugged\n- **Summary**: The global crude oil supply chain is undergoing a delicate reshuffling. According to geopolitical observers, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has recently significantly reduced its reliance on Russian crude oil and purchased approximately 6 million barrels of West African and Middle Eastern crude oil scheduled for delivery in April. This move is seen by outside observers as a tactical adjustment by India to align with trade negotiations with Washington. Meanwhile, Venezuelan crude oil continues to flow into Europe, with approximately 2 million barrels currently being shipped to Spain. These actions clearly demonstrate that, under the influence of global sanctions and trade frictions, major energy-importing countries are accelerating the diversification of their supply channels, attempting to find a balance in the complex geopolitical game.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Geopolitics Unplugged](https://geopoliticsunplugged.substack.com/p/elections-thai-shift-japan-ldp-wins)\n\n### 15. The trade deadlock between South Korea and the United States remains unresolved, with Seoul lobbying urgently to maintain preferential tariffs.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Politico\n- **Summary**: According to Politico, South Korean government officials have been frequently visiting Washington recently, engaging in urgent lobbying. Amid renewed tariff threats from the Trump administration, South Korea is attempting to maintain its current preferential tariff rate at 15%. The report specifically mentions that the regulatory investigation into Coupang, the e-commerce giant often referred to as the \"Korean Amazon,\" has become a focal point of trade negotiations between the two countries. South Korea is concerned that if this dispute cannot be resolved, it will directly impact its semiconductor and electronics exports. Meanwhile, Seoul is also observing how China responds to tariff challenges, attempting to find a trade route between the two major powers, the US and China, to avoid collateral damage.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/08/amazon-of-south-korea-becomes-a-flashpoint-in-trumps-trade-talks-00770201)\n\n### 16. Chinese regulators have advised financial institutions to reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds to mitigate risks.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: A significant development revealed today by *Trade Economics* indicates that Chinese regulators have privately urged domestic financial institutions to reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds. The report analyzes that the primary purpose of this move is to mitigate market valuation risks arising from fluctuations in Federal Reserve policy, as well as the increasing geopolitical concentration risks. The report points out that this move is highly indicative of market trends, as it occurs amidst the People's Bank of China's continued large-scale liquidity injections. If implemented on a large scale, this could further push up long-term US Treasury yields and have a profound impact on the allocation of global foreign exchange reserves. China is proactively preparing for potential sharp global financial fluctuations through dynamic adjustments to its asset structure.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/currency/news/524042)\n\n### 17. The IMF forecasts global growth of 3.1% in 2026, making strategic minerals a new favorite for investment.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Investment Times Online\n- **Summary**: In its latest commodities outlook report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global economic growth of 3.1% for 2026. According to the Investment Times, despite persistently high geopolitical risks, this growth rate will provide significant support for global stock markets and commodity demand. The report specifically emphasizes that the commodities market is entering a period of \"structural transformation,\" with traditional oil investment shifting towards key strategic minerals to capitalize on opportunities arising from global electrification. Against this backdrop, gold producers, facing high mining costs, are actively increasing production forecasts in geopolitically secure regions to cope with an increasingly complex global macroeconomic environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Investment Times Online](https://investmenttimesonline.com/2026/02/09/gold-projected-to-rise-in-q1-miif-report/)\n\n### 18. US consumer credit exceeded expectations in December, leading to a weak performance in US stock futures.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Trading Economics\n- **Summary**: According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor and financial markets, U.S. consumer credit growth in December far exceeded expectations, indicating that U.S. households still face heavy borrowing pressure amid persistently high interest rates. As a result, U.S. stock futures performed weakly today, with investors anxious about the upcoming non-farm payroll report and CPI data. Currently, expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut have been postponed to June or even September of this year. This station observes that although one-year inflation expectations have fallen to a low point, the abnormal growth in consumer credit has raised market concerns about future inflation recurrence. Wall Street is currently in a wait-and-see mode, attempting to sift through conflicting macroeconomic signals to discern a clear trading logic.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/stock-market)\n\n### 19. Nigerian telecom giant MTN plans to acquire IHS for $2.7 billion amid active infrastructure investment.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Punch Newspapers\n- **Summary**: In the African market, according to Nigeria's *Punch* newspaper, telecom giant MTN is in advanced talks to acquire IHS Tower for $2.76 billion. This massive acquisition is seen as a significant signal of a recovery in investment in the region's digital communications infrastructure. Despite facing challenges from macroeconomic volatility, fintech solutions have demonstrated remarkable resilience in Nigeria. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission today clarified its electricity metering policy, aiming to regulate the market and ensure sustainable infrastructure development. These developments indicate that Africa's largest economy is attempting to mitigate external financial shocks through digitalization and energy reform.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/)\n\n### 20. There are signs of unwinding in yen carry trades, putting emerging market liquidity to the test.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Saxo Bank\n- **Summary**: According to Saxo Bank's Asian market briefing released on February 9, there are clear signs of unwinding in yen carry trades due to investor expectations of potential surprise actions from the Federal Reserve. This shift is posing a significant challenge to overall liquidity in emerging markets. The report points out that as global fiscal deficits continue to widen, institutional buyers (such as macro funds and family offices) are gradually shifting from traditional safe-haven assets to \"hard assets\" such as gold. The report emphasizes that this deleveraging process could exacerbate volatility in emerging market sovereign debt. For countries reliant on external financing, the macroeconomic data releases in the coming week will be crucial in determining their financial stability.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Saxo Bank](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/content/articles/commodities/silver-surges-to-fresh-record-highs-as-structural-tightness-meets-macro-tailwinds-01122025)",
