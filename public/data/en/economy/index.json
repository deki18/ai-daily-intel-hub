    "summary": "According to our station, at this crucial moment before the release of the Federal Reserve's January meeting minutes, a clear \"hawkish-dove confrontation\" is emerging among officials regarding monetary policy. Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr stated clearly on Tuesday that interest rates should remain high for some time until inflation consistently and steadily moves towards the 2% target, reflecting the Fed's internal vigilance regarding sticky inflation. However, Chicago Fed President Goolsby released a relatively dovish signal. In an interview, he pointed out that several rate cuts this year are possible if the labor market continues to cool and inflation gets on track. Currently, the market is paying close attention to Wednesday's meeting minutes with high caution, and the dollar index has risen above 97.22, boosted by this expectation. Analysts point out that the recent stronger-than-expected non-farm payroll data has made the Fed's policy choices in the first quarter more complex, with most officials preferring to digest the current policy contradictions through more economic data.",

    "summary": "According to the latest news received by this station, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman delivered an important speech at the American Bankers Association conference. Bowman pointed out that since the 2008 financial crisis, traditional banks' market share in mortgage lending and advisory services has declined significantly. To address this structural change, Bowman revealed that the Federal Reserve is currently developing two specific regulations for mortgage lending, with the core objective of rebalancing the industry structure and stabilizing the cornerstone role of banks in the financial markets. Observers point out that Federal Reserve officials will be speaking frequently this week, and the market is holding its breath awaiting the release of the FOMC meeting minutes on Thursday, attempting to find the latest policy clues on how the Fed will respond to the deteriorating labor market and potential tariff inflationary pressures.",

    "path": "/data/en/economy/archive/2026-02-09.json",
    "summary": "According to our report, as of February 9, 2026, the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target rate for the federal funds rate will remain at 3.75%. Although inflation expectations have been revised downwards in a University of Michigan survey, the US Treasury yield curve showed a slight flattening trend on February 8. Currently, the market is most focused on the new proposal put forward by Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee for the next Federal Reserve Chairman. According to Bloomberg, Warsh proposed establishing a so-called \"Federal Reserve-Treasury Agreement,\" a concept that has sparked heated debate in the market. Investors worry that this move may imply that the Federal Reserve will have to indirectly support fiscal expansion by purchasing Treasury bonds in the future. Affected by this expectation, the spread between 2-year and 10-year US Treasury yields is currently still at a four-year high of approximately 69 to 74 basis points. Reports indicate that the global bond market is holding its breath awaiting the upcoming non-farm payroll and CPI data for clearer interest rate guidance.",

    "summary": "According to our report, official data updated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) on February 8, 2026, shows that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors decided to maintain the upper limit of the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.75%. The report indicates that this rate level has remained unchanged since early February, fully reflecting the Federal Open Market Committee's consistent stance of seeking to maintain monetary policy stability following its recent meetings. Observers point out that in the current macroeconomic environment, the Fed's move aims to provide the market with clear policy expectations, addressing potential economic volatility and ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial system by maintaining the existing interest rate framework.",

    "category": "economy",
    "path": "/data/en/economy/archive/2026-02-06.json",
    "summary": "According to Reuters and various economic data monitoring, inflationary pressures in the United States have shown a significant rebound in the past 24 hours. The latest report indicates that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate is currently holding at 3%, a figure not only far above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%, but also showing a further upward trend. As a result, the market has drastically revised its expectations regarding the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shift. Based on current interest rate futures pricing, the market generally predicts that the Fed will adopt a more cautious path, expecting only two rate cuts throughout 2026, while the originally anticipated first rate cut may be postponed to June of this year. Analysts point out that the stickiness of inflation presents the Federal Reserve with a greater challenge in balancing economic growth and price stability.",
