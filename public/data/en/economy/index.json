    "summary": "According to our report, as of February 9, 2026, the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target rate for the federal funds rate will remain at 3.75%. Although inflation expectations have been revised downwards in a University of Michigan survey, the US Treasury yield curve showed a slight flattening trend on February 8. Currently, the market is most focused on the new proposal put forward by Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee for the next Federal Reserve Chairman. According to Bloomberg, Warsh proposed establishing a so-called \"Federal Reserve-Treasury Agreement,\" a concept that has sparked heated debate in the market. Investors worry that this move may imply that the Federal Reserve will have to indirectly support fiscal expansion by purchasing Treasury bonds in the future. Affected by this expectation, the spread between 2-year and 10-year US Treasury yields is currently still at a four-year high of approximately 69 to 74 basis points. Reports indicate that the global bond market is holding its breath awaiting the upcoming non-farm payroll and CPI data for clearer interest rate guidance.",

    "summary": "According to our report, official data updated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) on February 8, 2026, shows that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors decided to maintain the upper limit of the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.75%. The report indicates that this rate level has remained unchanged since early February, fully reflecting the Federal Open Market Committee's consistent stance of seeking to maintain monetary policy stability following its recent meetings. Observers point out that in the current macroeconomic environment, the Fed's move aims to provide the market with clear policy expectations, addressing potential economic volatility and ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial system by maintaining the existing interest rate framework.",

    "category": "economy",
    "path": "/data/en/economy/archive/2026-02-06.json",
    "summary": "According to Reuters and various economic data monitoring, inflationary pressures in the United States have shown a significant rebound in the past 24 hours. The latest report indicates that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate is currently holding at 3%, a figure not only far above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%, but also showing a further upward trend. As a result, the market has drastically revised its expectations regarding the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shift. Based on current interest rate futures pricing, the market generally predicts that the Fed will adopt a more cautious path, expecting only two rate cuts throughout 2026, while the originally anticipated first rate cut may be postponed to June of this year. Analysts point out that the stickiness of inflation presents the Federal Reserve with a greater challenge in balancing economic growth and price stability.",
