    "summary": "According to Xinhua News Agency, on February 4, 2026, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a video conference to jointly commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Russia strategic partnership. During the talks, President Xi Jinping emphasized that in the face of the current turbulent international situation, deepening strategic cooperation between China and Russia is not only a necessity for bilateral relations but also a cornerstone for maintaining global strategic stability. President Putin highly praised the bilateral relationship as a \"model\" of cooperation between major powers, and particularly commended the strong resilience shown by China-Russia trade against the backdrop of Western sanctions. On the same day, Foreign Minister Wang Yi also met with Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, in Beijing. The two sides reached further understandings on implementing the consensus reached by the heads of state and supporting each other on core interests.",

    "summary": "According to the latest news received by this station, on February 4, 2026, with the active mediation of the United States, delegations from Russia and Ukraine officially began the second round of closed-door peace talks in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Ukrainian delegation was led by Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security Council. According to The New York Times, the core issues of this round of negotiations revolved around the status of eastern Ukraine and post-war security guarantees. Although the Trump administration had previously signaled that \"the talks might make progress,\" both sides maintained a hardline stance. Putin insisted that Ukraine cede parts of the Donetsk region, currently under Ukrainian control, while Zelenskyy explicitly stated that he would never accept this. Furthermore, the Kremlin is hostile to any security agreements involving the presence of Western troops on Ukrainian territory, making the negotiation process still fraught with challenges.",

    "path": "/data/en/archive/2026-02-03.json",
    "summary": "According to our station, the only remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), is scheduled to expire on February 5, 2026. The two sides have yet to reach a renewal or replacement agreement, raising strong concerns among global defense experts about a potential \"vacuum\" in nuclear force oversight. Reports indicate that once the treaty expires, bilateral on-site verification and data exchange mechanisms will completely cease. Analysis suggests that the US has the capability to increase its deployed nuclear warheads by 110% within months, while Russia could increase them by as much as 60%. This not only signifies a loss of transparency but could also trigger an uncontrollable global arms race in the absence of a dispute resolution mechanism.",

Khamenei characterized the recent domestic protests as a premeditated \"coup\" and issued a clear warning to Washington, stating that any US military action against Iran would trigger an uncontrollable \"regional war.\" Currently, the Iranian military has conducted a two-day live-fire exercise in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz to demonstrate its military capability to blockade the waterway. Tehran emphasized that in the face of external threats, Iran will take all necessary measures to retaliate forcefully. This statement has instantly caused the risk of war in the Middle East to surge.",

According to reports from The Guardian and the South China Morning Post, both sides agreed to establish a \"more mature and long-term\" comprehensive strategic partnership, shifting the focus to pragmatic economic cooperation. As a gesture of goodwill, China announced the lifting of previous restrictions on some British MPs, and British giants such as AstraZeneca subsequently announced major investment plans in China. Despite ongoing controversies within the UK regarding security issues, the British side expressed a desire to improve bilateral trade through soft power means such as \"football diplomacy,\" and even opened the possibility of a future visit by a Chinese head of state to the UK.",

Bloomberg reported that although the Senate had previously passed the bills by a large majority, they failed to be enacted due to the early departure of House members from Washington. President Trump had previously warned that the shutdown would limit the functions of several government agencies. Currently, the White House is urging lawmakers to return on Monday and reconsider the bills to minimize their impact on the operation of the country. This deadlock reflects the serious domestic political challenges Trump faces during his term.",
