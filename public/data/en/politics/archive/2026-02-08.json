In the past 24 hours, tensions and diplomatic maneuvering have been intertwined on the international stage. From the sudden emergence of a 'peace timetable' in the Russia-Ukraine conflict to the escalating missile confrontation in the Middle East, and the severe security challenges in Africa's Sahel region, the world order is at a profound turning point. In this episode, I will provide a precise overview of 20 major events that have impacted global processes in the past 24 hours. We will focus on the cross-regional deployment of US aircraft carriers, China's major breakthrough in low-Earth orbit defense technology, and the ideological rifts emerging within NATO.

Analysts believe this specific timetable may indicate that Washington is exerting greater diplomatic pressure on Kyiv. Meanwhile, the power struggle on the front lines has extended to the sea. British defense sources stated that the UK has developed a detailed military plan, with the support of NATO allies, to seize a Russian-linked \"shadow convoy\" oil tanker. This represents a significant escalation following previous actions in the North Atlantic, reflecting NATO's intensified strategic containment of Moscow from both economic and military perspectives by cutting off Russia's energy transport arteries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-general-trump-zelensky-peace-deadline-b2916140.html)\n  - [2] [Mehr News Agency](https://en.mehrnews.com/)\n\n### 2.

Ukraine used its domestically produced 'Flamingo' missile to attack Russia's Kapustin Yar base.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: The Defense News\n- **Summary**: The latest combat report received by this station indicates that the Ukrainian army recently deployed its newly developed FP-5 'Flamingo' high-precision long-range missiles to launch a targeted strike against the Kapustin Yar missile test range in Russia. According to Defense News, the attack targeted Russian long-range strike facilities, aiming to weaken Russia's strategic bombing capabilities within Ukraine at their source. Although the Kremlin has not officially confirmed the specific extent of damage, military analysts point out that this action demonstrates Ukraine's significant progress in the indigenization of strategic weapons, giving it the capability to conduct sustained precision strikes against key military targets throughout Russia. On the same day, retaliatory airstrikes by Russian forces on Kyiv triggered a severe energy crisis.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Defense News](https://www.thedefensenews.com/news-details/Ukrainian-Forces-Target-Oreshnik-Missile-Facilities-at-Russias-Kapustin-Yar-Range-Using-FP-5-Flamingo-Missiles/)\n\n### 4. NATO strengthens military presence in Eastern Europe, escalating tensions in the Baltic Sea.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: YouTube (NATO Updates)\n- **Summary**: According to an official NATO update, with 2026 considered a crucial juncture in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO has significantly strengthened its military presence in the Baltic and Eastern European regions. This operation involves multiple member states, including Turkey, and involves large-scale troop mobilization and the deployment of advanced weaponry. Observers have expressed deep concern, believing that this high-intensity military deterrence, coupled with Ukraine's recent attacks on strategic targets within Russia, could easily trigger a large-scale retaliatory strike from Russia, and could even lead to a direct military confrontation between NATO and Russia. Currently, the entire Eastern European flank is on high alert.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [YouTube (NATO Updates)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTXCFmLf1ug)\n\n### 5. Israel launched airstrikes on multiple locations in Iran and Lebanon, destroying Revolutionary Guard missile depots.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Liveuamap\n- **Summary**: The situation in the Middle East has once again become extremely volatile. Real-time battle maps show that the Israeli Air Force launched intensive and precise strikes against multiple key geopolitical locations in the Middle East. Within Iranian territory, Israeli warplanes penetrated deep into the Yazd mountains, heavily bombing a core base and related missile depot of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), reportedly causing severe damage. Simultaneously, the Ansar and Zalariyah regions north of the Litani River in Lebanon were also subjected to two surgical airstrikes. Furthermore, certain areas in Idlib city, Syria, were not spared. This series of actions indicates that Israel's military strategy has shifted from border skirmishes to transnational, long-range strikes against key enemy military assets, and the risk of regional war is rapidly increasing.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Liveuamap](https://liveuamap.com/)\n\n### 6. The commander of U.S. Central Command inspected the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and emphasized the deterrent capability in the Arabian Sea.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: The Defense News\n- **Summary**: According to Defense News, Admiral Michael Eric Culilla, Commander of U.S. Central Command, recently inspected the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group deployed in the Arabian Sea. Notably, this carrier was originally planned for deployment in the Pacific region, but was urgently transferred to the Middle East via the Strait of Malacca in January of this year. This marks the third time in recent years that the U.S. military has dynamically redeployed an aircraft carrier from its Pacific Command area of responsibility to address security challenges in the Middle East. During his inspection, Admiral Culilla emphasized that the U.S. military must ensure absolute maritime security and deterrence in key waterways such as the Arabian Sea. This force movement clearly reflects the U.S. military's attempt, through a dynamic balancing strategy, to fill the strategic vacuum created by the deteriorating situation in the Middle East amidst a multipolar global conflict.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Defense News](https://www.thedefensenews.com/)\n\n### 7. China pledged at the APEC meeting to strengthen cooperation on food security in the Asia-Pacific region.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: 新华社\n- **Summary**: BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huanxin, director of the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration of China, delivered an important speech at the APEC Food Security Policy Partnership Meeting in Guangzhou.

The Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology in China is developing microwave weapons aimed at countering the Starlink system.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Hindustan Times Bangla\n- **Summary**: According to multiple sources, including the Hindustan Times, experts at the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT) in China are developing a high-energy microwave (HPM) weapon, with its core objective being SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. The research background indicates that, given Starlink's powerful military communications support capabilities demonstrated in modern conflicts such as the Ukraine crisis, China has expressed strategic concerns about the security of its low-Earth orbit assets and its information hegemony. Reportedly, the breakthrough of this technology lies in its ability to precisely blind or physically destroy satellite electronic systems without generating large amounts of space debris or damaging the orbital environment. If successfully deployed, this weapon could fundamentally alter the strategic balance in the future aerospace domain, becoming a key tool for countering low-Earth orbit satellite constellations.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Hindustan Times Bangla](https://www.hindustantimes.com/bangla/sitemap/news.xml)\n\n### 9. US aircraft carriers are on high alert in the Gulf of Oman, facing the threat of Iranian missile suppression.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: The Telegraph\n- **Summary**: According to The Daily Telegraph, a U.S. Navy carrier strike group deployed in the Gulf of Oman entered a state of high alert on Sunday. Intelligence indicates that Iranian forces have reinforced the deployment of advanced missile systems along this strategic route. Internal U.S. military assessments reveal concerns about the ability to achieve a tactical victory against a concentrated and highly mobile Iranian missile strike. This maritime standoff is not only a microcosm of the U.S.-Iranian military rivalry but also directly impacts the security of global energy supply lines at the gateway to the Persian Gulf. Currently, the U.S. is evaluating possible defense strategies and potential retaliatory strike options. The limitations of missile defense technology in dealing with saturation attacks have plunged the situation in the Gulf of Oman into its most severe stalemate since the 20th century.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/08/us-navy-carrier-gulf-oman-iran-missiles-war-spark/)\n\n### 10. Poland rises to become a security core on NATO's eastern flank; major airports resume operations.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-08\n- **Source**: Anadolu Agency, Politiko.al\n- **Summary**: Poland is reshaping the European security landscape at an unprecedented pace. According to Anadolu Agency, through large-scale procurement of modern armored vehicles, long-range artillery, and air defense systems, Poland has become a de facto 'security hub' on NATO's eastern flank and a central base for US troops in Europe. Scholars at Jagiellonian University believe that Poland is becoming an indispensable new power pole within the EU. Furthermore, after experiencing martial law following the Russian attack, Poland's important airport, which had been closed, reopened on February 7th, seen as a sign of the restoration of order in the region. Polish Prime Minister Tusk reiterated that Poland bears the heavy responsibility of guarding NATO and the EU's eastern borders, and that Poland's defense capabilities will directly determine Europe's strategic stability.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/-indispensable-new-pole-poland-reshapes-europe-s-security-map/3812047)\n  - [2] [Politiko.al](https://politiko.al/english/e-tjera/pas-32-vitesh-hapet-porta-e-tunelit-te-fortifikuar-te-porto-palermos-i512698)\n\n### 11.

According to CBS News, Trump explicitly demanded that Ukraine and Russia reach a peace agreement by June and plans to personally meet with Iranian representatives next week to de-escalate regional tensions. Behind the scenes, US General Alexis Greenkiewicz successfully facilitated the resumption of high-level military dialogue between the US and Russia after a four-year hiatus, aiming to build channels of communication for lasting peace. However, Trump also issued a stern warning to Tehran, stating that Iran would face serious consequences if a consensus on a nuclear agreement was not reached. This \"grand deal\" diplomatic style is profoundly testing the confidence of NATO allies in their commitment to transatlantic security.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/07/trump-turns-us-military-leaders-diplomatic-efforts-iran-and-ukraine.html)\n  - [2] [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/us-iran-tensions/2/)\n\n### 12.

Both sides emphasized the strategic importance of Turkey's relationship with the EU, agreeing that strengthening bilateral ties is crucial for maintaining regional stability in a volatile international context. This demonstrates that while fulfilling its NATO military responsibilities, Ankara is actively seeking to improve its political relations with the EU to gain a favorable position in the complex transatlantic power struggle.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Daily Sabah](https://www.dailysabah.com/)\n\n### 13.

In response to the dual pressures of power and military operations, the Ukrainian military has taken an unexpected step: for the first time, they have adapted their active-duty military drone simulators into a video game for global players. Kyiv hopes that this approach will not only raise global public awareness but also cultivate a pool of potential drone remote operation talent. Meanwhile, across the Pacific, the FBI has also increased its monitoring of unauthorized drone activity in preparation for the upcoming Super Bowl.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n  - [2] [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/ukraine-crisis/)\n\n### 14.

Notably, Admiral Brad Cooper, Commander of U.S. Central Command, accompanied the special envoy to the negotiations for the first time in military uniform, a move widely interpreted as a strong signal of a balance between military deterrence and diplomatic dialogue. The current context is exceptionally serious: with the New START Treaty officially expiring on February 5th, the only remaining red line for nuclear arms control between the U.S. and Russia no longer exists. Iranian Foreign Minister Agrazi reiterated during the negotiations that while Iran does not reject dialogue, it will launch a full-scale attack on U.S. bases in the region should it be attacked. Currently, the two sides are holding closed-door consultations on uranium enrichment limits and the framework for the nuclear dispute.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/07/trump-turns-us-military-leaders-diplomatic-efforts-iran-and-ukraine.html)\n  - [2] [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/news_sitemap.xml)\n\n### 16.

According to the latest report on February 7, the attack has resulted in the deaths of at least 36 Nigerien soldiers. This incident once again highlights the growing threat of cross-border armed conflict in the Sahel region. Despite efforts by governments in the region to strengthen military cooperation, the infiltration capabilities and intensity of attacks by jihadist militants continue to put immense pressure on local defense systems, and the living conditions of civilians in the region continue to deteriorate.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [West Africa & Sahel Security Brief](https://zagazola.org/index.php/security-analysis/west-africa-sahel-security-brief-period-covered-1-7-february-2026)\n\n### 17.
