In the recently concluded snap election, the conservative Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's camp won an absolute majority of seats, securing policy continuity for the future. Following the election, Takaichi issued a strong statement emphasizing Japan's need to comprehensively protect its territorial waters, airspace, and national sovereignty. This station observes that with the election results finalized, the Japanese government plans to further enhance its intelligence gathering and strategic analysis capabilities. Experts point out that Takaichi's victory indicates that Japan will continue to rely on the Japan-US alliance as the cornerstone of its diplomacy, while further strengthening its strategic deterrence against the backdrop of an increasingly complex security situation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [GeopoliticsUnplugged](https://geopoliticsunplugged.substack.com/p/elections-thai-shift-japan-ldp-wins)\n  - [2] [News18](https://www.news18.com/commonfeeds/v1/eng/sitemap/google-news.xml)\n\n### 2. Thailand's general election results are in: The Bhumjaithai Party pulls off a surprise victory and pushes for a constitutional referendum.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-09\n- **Source**: Astro Awani, Bloomberg\n- **Summary**: According to our combined reports, Thailand's 2026 general election has concluded after a fierce contest. Deputy Prime Minister Anutin's Bhumjaithai party, leveraging its nationalist narrative and strong rural alliances, achieved a major upset victory, reshaping the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. Simultaneously, voters passed a referendum to repeal the 2017 military-backed constitution, marking a crucial step towards political reform in Thailand. However, analysts such as Bloomberg point out that due to the long-standing rivalry between royal conservatives and democratic forces, the formation of a new government still faces significant uncertainty, and the situation carries the risk of prolonged instability.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Astro Awani](https://international.astroawani.com/global-news/thailand-pm-anutin-consolidates-power-dominating-election-win-558823)\n  - [2] [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-07/high-stakes-thai-vote-tests-appetite-for-political-reform)\n\n### 3.

In the past 24 hours, leaders of several key Western powers, including Norway, Finland, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain, have embarked on visits to China. Analysts believe this signifies a strategic awakening of middle powers within a multipolar world order. These countries are attempting to counter China strategically by strengthening economic, trade, and technological ties, rather than engaging in a purely ideological shift. This trend of \"strategic risk aversion\" is becoming a core characteristic of current international relations.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [GeopoliticsUnplugged](https://geopoliticsunplugged.substack.com/p/elections-thai-shift-japan-ldp-wins)\n\n### 4.

The battle for the city has been ongoing for months, and the fighting on the front lines has now reached a fever pitch. Meanwhile, the latest battlefield reconnaissance shows that as many Eastern European countries have integrated into the NATO framework, the region's defensive focus has shifted significantly. Interviews reveal that under this high-intensity war of attrition, the contradiction between the ideal of \"pan-European security\" and the realities of the struggle are becoming increasingly prominent.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [inkl / Kyiv military](https://www.inkl.com/glance/news/ukraine-russia-war-latest-suspect-in-attack-on-putin-s-general-is-extradited-to-moscow-from-dubai)\n  - [2] [Anarchist Federation](https://www.anarchistfederation.net/behind-the-frontlines-an-interview-with-andrew-after-the-ukrainian-counteroffensive/)\n\n### 10.

For the first time since the height of the Cold War in 1972, the world's two largest nuclear powers will be without any treaty constraints. Despite strong international calls, the Trump administration has failed to reach a renewal agreement with Moscow. Although Trump claims to want to seek a \"more modern\" alternative, the size of the nuclear arsenal is now free from legal constraints. This situation has plunged the global security landscape into its most unpredictable and dangerous state since the end of the Cold War.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/world/nuclear-arms-control-japan-election.html)",
