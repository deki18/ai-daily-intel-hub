Welcome to today's focus. The global geopolitical landscape is currently undergoing profound adjustments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, where great power competition continues to evolve. In the past 24 hours, the international community has focused on diplomatic developments in the South China Sea, dramatic changes in US domestic legal and economic policies, and potential military risks in the Middle East. We will summarize 20 major events that have impacted global processes in the past 24 hours. The Philippines, as the ASEAN chair, has expressed optimism about completing negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, but the effectiveness of its \"decisive transparency\" strategy in the South China Sea is being scrutinized. Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court ruling has dealt a major setback to President Trump's economic agenda, but the president quickly announced new tariffs, foreshadowing uncertainty in future international trade relations. In the Middle East, the Iranian nuclear negotiations are progressing with difficulty against the backdrop of escalating military deployments. In today's program, we will provide an in-depth analysis of these key developments. Stay tuned.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1.

The United States, Australia, and the Philippines held a multilateral maritime cooperation activity in the waters west of Luzon Island to strengthen security coordination in the Indo-Pacific region.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: Mirage News\n- **Summary**: Australia, the Philippines, and the United States conducted a multilateral maritime cooperation activity, codenamed MCA, in the waters west of Luzon Island in the Philippines in mid-month. The Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Tuomba reportedly sailed and flew alongside the Philippine Coast Guard and the US Navy destroyer USS Dewey, conducting maritime command maneuvers and replenishment exercises. Notably, the Philippine Navy's newly commissioned frigate BRP Diego Cirón also participated in the operation. This move aimed to promote transparent regional cooperation, maintain an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, and reaffirm the commitment to upholding international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in freedom of navigation operations. This activity occurred against the backdrop of continued tensions in the South China Sea, with Manila adopting a two-pronged approach: maintaining communication with China while strengthening security cooperation with allies.

The Philippines reiterated its commitment to maintaining open dialogue channels with China and its adherence to a \"principled diplomacy\" approach in the South China Sea to advance its national interests.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: Reuters\n- **Summary**: The Philippine Foreign Ministry reiterated on Friday that despite occasional tensions in its interactions with the Chinese embassy, it remains committed to advancing national interests through \"effective and principled diplomacy.\" This statement comes against the backdrop of a series of maritime incidents between the two countries in the South China Sea. According to this station, Manila is currently employing a two-track strategy: maintaining a tough stance on protecting its maritime rights while continuing dialogue with Beijing to avoid escalation. This strategy also reflects its efforts to achieve a balance in the complex geopolitics of the South China Sea, namely strengthening security cooperation with countries like the United States and Canada while simultaneously seeking to manage differences with China. Other diplomatic sources revealed that the Philippine Foreign Minister warned that public rhetoric could shrink the country's \"diplomatic space\" on the South China Sea issue.

Indo-Pacific Geopolitical Outlook 2026: US-China Competition and India's Strategic Autonomy\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: SpecialEurasia\n- **Summary**: According to an analysis report by SpecialEurasia, the political and strategic dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region in 2026 will be primarily driven by the US-China competition, directly influencing regional security priorities and the direction of economic governance. The report points out that the centrality of geographical location remains prominent, with countries controlling key maritime passages (such as the Straits of Malacca and Luzon) having a supervisory role over trade flows connecting OPEC and East Asia. Competition for oil and gas fields in the South China Sea has exacerbated territorial disputes and militarization processes among China, Japan, and the United States. Furthermore, India is positioning itself as a balancing force, countering China's expansionist tendencies by strengthening cooperation with ASEAN, Japan, Australia, and the United States, while simultaneously maintaining partnerships with Iran, Russia, and the \"Global South\" to preserve its \"strategic autonomy.\" The report specifically mentions that Beijing considers the Strait of Malacca a strategic priority and maintains close attention to Thailand and Indonesia.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [SpecialEurasia](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2026/01/07/asia-pacific-risk-2026/)\n\n### 5. Southeast Asian countries are seeking “third-party involvement” and diversification to counter the US “sphere of influence” strategy and China’s influence.\n- **Time**: 2025-12-18\n- **Source**: ASEAN Wonk\n- **Summary**: Regarding geopolitical trends in 2026, ASEAN Wonk's analysis points out that as the US government adopts a \"sphere of influence\" strategy and China is seen as a more \"leading\" partner, Southeast Asian countries are increasing their emphasis on \"third-party involvement\" and \"diversification\" to address the challenges posed by great power competition. On the South China Sea issue, some analysts believe that Manila's (Philippines') \"decisive transparency\" strategy may be at risk of failing. Furthermore, the report mentions the constraints Europe faces in building an \"anti-China alliance,\" primarily stemming from India's strengthened ties with Russia and the US's imposition of high tariffs on Indian imports. This forces the EU to adopt a more pragmatic, sectoral cooperation approach rather than ideological alliances.

CSIS Annual Preview Focuses on the Indo-Pacific Region in 2026: Evolution of Alliance Networks and Technological Competition\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: CSIS Events\n- **Summary**: The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Geopolitics and Foreign Policy recently held its annual preview event, focusing on how the U.S. alliance network in the Indo-Pacific region will evolve in 2026. Experts discussed the impact of tariff policies and technological competition on regional economic dynamics, and whether the regional power balance will shift towards authoritarian states. Participants included Victor Cha, Charles Edel, Kristi Govella, and Gregory B. Poling. CSIS's forecasts indicate that dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region will continue to be profoundly influenced by U.S.-China competition, and the event highlights the sustainability of U.S. security commitments in the region, particularly against the backdrop of potential strategic shifts by the Trump administration.

India maintains its \"strategic autonomy\" stance and plays a balancing role in countering China's expansion.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: GSBN\n- **Summary**: According to GSBN's analysis, India is seen as a significant balancing force and agenda setter in 2026, a \"voice for the global south.\" India is committed to cultivating long-term, trust-based partnerships, such as through its \"Act East\" policy in Southeast Asia, and through mechanisms like I2U2 and energy security in a broader region, to effectively counter China's expansionist tendencies. However, India is resolutely avoiding rigid alliances and maintaining its stance of \"strategic autonomy.\" The report notes that India's strengthened ties with Russia have put some diplomatic pressure on the US government. Meanwhile, in terms of energy procurement, recent reports indicate that India is increasing its purchases of Saudi oil while reducing its dependence on Russian crude.

Against the backdrop of the Munich Agreement, the United States urged its allies to demonstrate \"collective strength\" to contain China, while tensions in the South China Sea continued.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: South China Morning Post (SCMP)\n- **Summary**: Against the backdrop of the Munich Security Conference, the United States and its Indo-Pacific and European allies emphasized the need for strengthened cooperation to counter Beijing's military buildup. This call aligns with current regional tensions, particularly the ongoing friction in the South China Sea. Other reports indicate that despite potential signs of economic rapprochement between the US and China, the risk of war in the Taiwan Strait remains. Sources suggest the US may increase its military footprint in Southeast Asia due to its strengthened stance towards China. Meanwhile, regarding the South China Sea situation, reports indicate that a Hainan official involved in assisting with the construction of artificial islands is under investigation for corruption.

Indo-Pacific Geopolitical Outlook 2026: Potential Strategic Shifts by the Trump Administration Raise Concerns Among Regional Allies\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: Wellington\n- **Summary**: Wellington's 2026 Geopolitical Outlook projects a negative structural outlook, primarily driven by the great power competition between the US and China and the fragmentation of the global order. One key trend of concern is the potential diplomatic stance of the Trump administration in the Asia-Pacific region, which may seek a more \"transactional\" approach to security. Analysts suggest that this potential US retrenchment or pursuit of a \"modus vivendi\" (a change of lifestyle) with China is causing concern among Indo-Pacific nations about the potential impact on their regional security commitments. On specific issues, the US decision not to take sides in the Japan-China dispute involving Taiwan, and the stagnation in relations with India, have further deepened regional anxieties.

Indonesia deepens its economic ties with China, seeking diplomatic flexibility to balance the influence of major powers.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: China Global South Project\n- **Summary**: Against the backdrop of increasingly dynamic great power influence, Indonesia has shown an economic inclination towards Beijing. Reports indicate that Indonesia recently reached a $10 billion agreement with China, seen as a deliberate move to align with Beijing on economic growth. Sources suggest that the development of Indonesian-Chinese relations is also influenced by broader geopolitical tensions, testing the diplomatic flexibility of countries in the region. We note that as early as August 2024, Indonesia and China held their first 2+2 high-level officials' meeting (foreign and defense ministers), marking an elevation in the level of their relationship. Southeast Asian analysts believe that, facing competition from the US and China, countries in the region are seeking \"strategic autonomy\" and diversified engagement.

India and Malaysia strengthen maritime security cooperation, reflecting India's increased focus on Southeast Asia.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-16\n- **Source**: Asia on the Horizon\n- **Summary**: Amid recent shifts in the Asian geopolitical landscape, India and Malaysia have emphasized cooperation in maritime security, counterterrorism, and defense training. This reflects India's deepening \"Act East\" policy and demonstrates its growing strategic focus on Southeast Asia. According to an analysis in the Asia on the Horizon briefing, India aims to strengthen multilateral cooperation through ASEAN to counterbalance China's growing influence. Meanwhile, regionally, we are seeing other domestic political changes translating into regional security signals, such as political consolidation in Tokyo and the divisive elections in Bangkok. The consequences of these domestic events are rapidly influencing the strategic trajectory of Asia.

The US Supreme Court overturned Trump's emergency global tariffs; the president immediately announced a new 10% global tariff.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: CBS News\n- **Summary**: This is breaking news. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Donald Trump's broad global tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were illegal, stating that the president lacked the constitutional power to impose such tariffs. IEEPA is a federal regulation enacted in 1977. However, shortly after the ruling, President Trump claimed the court was influenced by foreign interests and announced a new 10% tariff on all countries under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. An EU trade spokesperson stated they are carefully analyzing the ruling. Other reports indicate that large retailers say the previous tariffs have forced them to raise prices to offset costs, and experts believe businesses could face years of waiting for refunds.

President Trump expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn tariffs and hinted at military action by Iran.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: CBS News\n- **Summary**: US President Donald Trump expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's ruling overturning its global tariffs, calling the ruling a \"disgrace\" and suggesting the court was influenced by foreign interests, though he provided no concrete evidence. According to multiple sources cited by Reuters, immediately following the Supreme Court's ruling, President Trump not only announced new 10% global tariffs under the Trade Act of 1974 but also weighed the option of a limited military strike against Iran. This move comes at a time when negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue are still ongoing. Furthermore, the US Congress plans to vote on authorizing the use of force against Iran in response to its accumulation of highly enriched uranium. Analysts warn that military threats against Iran could backfire, triggering a cycle of retaliation.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un mentions economic difficulties and the impact of sanctions at a party congress.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: Taipei Times\n- **Summary**: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un presided over the quinquennial Workers' Party Congress. Reports indicate that Kim pledged to improve people's living standards in his speech, but this also indirectly revealed the severe economic pressures North Korea faces. Analysts believe these remarks were intended to alleviate domestic discontent stemming from food shortages, high military spending, and concerns over Russia's support for the war in Ukraine. North Korea's economy has been subject to severe Western sanctions for years, aimed at cutting off funding for its nuclear weapons program. Separately, reports indicate that China sent a congratulatory message to the Workers' Party of Korea, pledging joint efforts to develop the North Korean economy and improve people's livelihoods, demonstrating the continuity of bilateral relations.

Following the US Supreme Court's overturning of Trump's tariffs, large retailers are facing cost pressures, and economic growth is showing signs of stagnation.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: CBS News\n- **Summary**: Following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Trump administration's emergency tariffs on Friday, new developments have emerged in the U.S. economy. According to CBS News, major U.S. retailers stated that the Trump administration's previous tariffs had forced them to raise prices for customers to offset increased costs. Despite the tariffs being overturned, experts predict that businesses could face years of waiting to receive refunds for previously paid tariffs. Furthermore, the latest GDP data suggests that U.S. economic growth appeared to have stagnated in the last three months of last year, a situation linked to the impact of tariff policies on economic activity.

Hungary objects to the EU's €90 billion loan plan to Ukraine.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-20\n- **Source**: The New York Times\n- **Summary**: The EU is facing resistance regarding financial aid to Ukraine. According to a report from Brussels, at a meeting of EU ambassadors, Hungary explicitly opposed the EU's plan to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan, creating an obstacle to the aid package. This disagreement arises against the backdrop of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless, on the diplomatic front, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange involving 157 people, the first since last October. Separately, the US European Command announced it will resume high-level military dialogue with Russia to address the current situation.

According to CGTN, although negotiations are underway, US sanctions against Iran continue to exert pressure, which some analysts believe is detrimental to the peace process. Iran has made it clear that it is ready to reach a nuclear agreement if sanctions are lifted. However, the escalating tensions are manifesting on the military level: US President Trump has threatened to support Israel in striking Iran's missile program if negotiations fail. Meanwhile, the US aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford has entered the Mediterranean as part of a military buildup in the Middle East. Tensions in the Middle East continue, with both Iran and the US reinforcing their respective military deployments.

According to upi.com, the main agenda of the meeting is to provide Israel with an update on the progress of negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue. This diplomatic move comes against the backdrop of escalating military deployments by both the U.S. and Iran and the difficult progress of nuclear negotiations.

According to Wikipedia's event log, Russia and the United States have agreed to restore high-level military communication channels, the first such arrangement since the Biden administration suspended them in 2021. This move comes against the backdrop of the expiration of the New START nuclear weapons treaty. In another area of focus, the UN Security Council's North Korea Sanctions Committee approved exemptions for 17 humanitarian projects in North Korea to ensure that international organizations and NGOs can deliver aid under existing nuclear restrictions. Furthermore, the US military confirmed the deployment of 200 troops to Nigeria to assist local forces in combating terrorist organizations such as Boko Haram.

Analysis: Risks and Limitations of New US Military Action Against Iran\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: In Depth News\n- **Summary**: An opinion piece in In Depth News argues that a new US military action against Iran would be a disastrous escalation of the crisis already facing the Iranian people. The commentary contends that President Trump's threat of military action against Iran will not only fail to secure a nuclear agreement in Tehran, but could trigger a deadly cycle of retaliation. This view echoes the analysis by SCMP, which states that the risk of military escalation remains, despite the impending second round of nuclear negotiations. Meanwhile, the international attention is focused on protests and the risk of executions within Iran, highlighting the complex interplay between domestic politics and external pressures.

External actors such as the EU and India are reshaping interactions with ASEAN, while Southeast Asian countries are emphasizing strategic autonomy.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: SEAPublicPolicy\n- **Summary**: According to a SEAPublicPolicy report, by 2026, external actors such as the EU, South Korea, India, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are reshaping their interactions with ASEAN. Southeast Asian countries generally prioritize their \"strategic autonomy\" in dealing with relations with the US and China, which has somewhat hampered efforts by external powers to build a united front. Specifically, the EU's diversification strategy focuses on building economic and security partnerships to address China's risks, but India's increasingly complex relationship with Russia poses a challenge to Europe's attempts to build an \"anti-China alliance.\" This aligns with the overall trend of seeking balance in the Indo-Pacific region, with the Philippines also striving to strike a balance between dialogue with China and cooperation with the US.

According to CBS News, a Canadian airline has announced the suspension of flights to Cuba due to U.S. sanctions and tariff threats from the Trump administration. Havana had previously warned that refueling services for airlines on the island were no longer available due to various factors. The court ruling overturned the tariffs authorized by the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) invoked by Trump, and is seen as a major setback for his economic agenda.

Indo-Pacific Geopolitical Outlook: India's Strategy and the Future of the Quad\n- **Time**: 2026-02-21\n- **Source**: The Geostrata\n- **Summary**: The Geostrata analyzes the growing global role in the Indo-Pacific region, focusing on India's strategic positioning and its role in the Quad alliance. The region is attempting to find a new balance between democracy, security, and geoeconomics. The analysis notes that the US alliance network in the Indo-Pacific is evolving, particularly after the Trump administration's potential for a more \"transactional\" foreign policy, leading to doubts among regional partners about the reliability of US security commitments. India continues to emphasize its \"strategic autonomy,\" strengthening partnerships with the US and others while maintaining its long-standing cooperative relationship with Russia to play a balancing role in the region.
