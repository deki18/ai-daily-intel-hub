Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has expressed serious concern. According to Security Council data, since the ceasefire agreement was signed, Israel's military operation in Gaza has resulted in 601 deaths. Representatives from several Security Council members have strongly criticized Israel's expansionist plans in the West Bank, believing that this further jeopardizes the already bleak prospects for regional peace.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [TBS News](https://www.tbsnews.net/hamas-israel-war/trump-kicks-his-board-peace-eye-gaza-and-beyond-1365861)\n  - [2] [纽约时报](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/world/middleeast/security-council-israel-gaza-board-peace.html)\n\n### 9.

The Israeli army forcibly demolished a multi-story residential complex belonging to the Salhab family, directly displacing more than 40 civilians. Meanwhile, far-right Israeli cabinet members are pushing hard for a \"voluntary migration\" plan targeting Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, sparking strong international protests. In the diplomatic arena, Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mediate the increasingly open conflict between Saudi Arabia and the UAE over regional security policies, making the rebalancing of interests within the Middle East exceptionally complex.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2633530/middle-east)\n  - [2] [Al Arabiya](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2026/02/18/top-israeli-minister-pushes-for-emigration-of-west-bank-gaza-palestinians-)\n\n### 10.

Under the agreement, most Indonesian exports to the United States will face a 19% tariff, a rate higher than India's but on par with Malaysia's. In exchange, Indonesia agreed to eliminate tariffs on 99% of its U.S. imports. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto emphasized that the negotiating team maintained a high degree of caution during implementation, aiming to ensure that domestic industrial productivity is not affected by uncompetitive goods. The signing of this agreement marks a shift in Southeast Asian countries' efforts to mitigate the economic pressure of high tariffs through bilateral agreements under the Trump administration's new trade policies.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [星报 (The Star)](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2026/02/19/officials-urge-caution-ahead-of-us-agreement)\n\n### 17.

The IMF's Japan team leader noted that Japan has successfully buffered the impact of external trade protectionism through sound fiscal policies and structural reforms, demonstrating \"impressive\" resilience. This positive assessment not only boosts investor confidence in the Japanese market but also provides important economic support data for Sanae Takaichi's upcoming visit to Washington.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [国际货币基金组织 (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2026/02/18/tr-02162026-imf-japan-aiv-press-conference)\n\n### 18. The US tightens its economic blockade against Cuba, and a European energy pipeline malfunction triggers a supply crisis.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: 台北时报, Geopolitics Unplugged\n- **Summary**: According to the Taipei Times, the Trump administration has recently intensified its blockade against Cuba, focusing on the country's pillar industries: oil supplies, tourism, and tobacco. Washington has made it clear that this move aims to bring about regime change in Cuba. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Europe is also facing significant changes in its energy supply chain. Due to an emergency malfunction in the Druzhba oil pipeline, the EU has initiated repair plans and is attempting to find alternative routes. While this is ostensibly for \"repairs,\" it is also interpreted as a means for the EU to accelerate the elimination of sanctions exemptions for countries like Hungary and Slovakia. If alternative solutions are not found in time, these countries will face significant energy supply gaps.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [台北时报](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz)\n  - [2] [Geopolitics Unplugged](https://geopoliticsunplugged.substack.com/p/20-iranian-mini-subs-russian-corvette)\n\n### 19.

Trump harshly criticized the plan as a \"serious strategic mistake\" that would directly harm the core security interests of both the US and the UK. He specifically emphasized the irreplaceable importance of Diego Garcia, which currently hosts a vital military base shared by both the US and the UK. This statement demonstrates the Trump administration's hardline stance on control of global strategic strongholds, preferring to interfere in the sovereignty decisions of its allies rather than allow Diego Garcia to face any potential legal uncertainties.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Plataforma Media](https://www.plataformamedia.com/en/2026/02/19/trump-warns-uk-against-handing-over-chagos-islands-citing-strategic-importance-of-diego-garcia/)\n\n### 20. Lagarde may step down as central bank governor ahead of schedule; the limitations of the sanctions model have prompted academic reflection.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-19\n- **Source**: Le Monde, Russia Matters\n- **Summary**: According to the French newspaper Le Monde, rumors are circulating that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde may resign early, a potential personnel upheaval occurring at a critical time for Europe in dealing with US tariff pressure. Meanwhile, academia is also questioning the current global governance model. An analysis published in Foreign Affairs points out that in a multipolar world, the traditional \"sanctions-regime change\" formula is increasingly ineffective. Economic sanctions from a single country are being offset by emerging alternative trade networks, such as the INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor). The analysis warns that if the international community does not adjust its existing confrontational logic, geopolitics may descend into a disorderly game of \"voluntary alliances.\"\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [世界报 (Le Monde)](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2026/02/19/christine-lagarde-may-leave-european-central-bank-before-end-of-term_6750632_19.html)\n  - [2] [Russia Matters](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-feb-9-17-2026)",
