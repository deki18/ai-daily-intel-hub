Welcome to today's \"Global Perspective.\" It's February 6, 2026, and the global security landscape is at an extremely delicate and turbulent crossroads. In the following program, we will provide you with an in-depth analysis of 30 major events that have impacted global processes in the past 24 hours. Today's headlines focus on the rare warming of US-Russia relations—the high-level military dialogue hotline, which had been suspended for four years, has officially restarted. Meanwhile, the US-Iran nuclear negotiations in the Middle East have also begun in Oman under the shadow of President Trump's 'ultimatum.' On the battlefield in Ukraine, although diplomatic negotiations are taking place simultaneously in Abu Dhabi, the fighting has not subsided. The deployment of new hypersonic missiles by the Russian military and the paralysis of energy facilities are making the situation even more severe this winter. In addition, we will also pay attention to the technology race in the Indo-Pacific region, the defense adjustments within NATO, and new developments in the global nuclear arms race. With so much information, let's dive into the detailed reports.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. The US and Russia have restarted a high-level military hotline that had been suspended for four years in an attempt to reduce the risk of strategic miscalculation.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: 美联社 (AP)\n- **Summary**: According to the latest news from the Associated Press received by this station, the United States and Russia reached a major agreement on Thursday to restart a high-level military dialogue hotline that had been suspended for more than four years. This is a key step taken by the Trump administration since taking office to promote a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and reduce the risk of direct military conflict between major powers. The establishment of the hotline aims to ensure that the highest levels of the two militaries can speak directly in times of crisis. The Pentagon stated that although serious differences remain between the two sides on many strategic issues, restoring communication channels is crucial to preventing the escalation of the situation between nuclear powers due to miscalculation.

The Abu Dhabi peace talks concluded the following day with a prisoner exchange agreement reached by the US, Russia, and Ukraine.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: 卫报 (The Guardian)\n- **Summary**: According to a report by The Guardian, the second day of peace talks on the Ukraine crisis in Abu Dhabi, UAE, has concluded. Although Russia and Ukraine remain at odds on core ceasefire conditions—Russia insists on Ukraine's withdrawal from the entire Donbas, while Ukraine advocates a ceasefire along the existing front lines—the talks have not been entirely without progress. According to US special envoy Steve Witkov, the three parties have reached an agreement on a new round of large-scale prisoner exchanges. The talks, mediated by US President's son-in-law Jared Kushner, demonstrate Washington's active involvement in peace negotiations; however, it is widely believed that a substantial, long-term ceasefire agreement will require a lengthy and arduous process.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [卫报 (The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/05/second-day-of-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-in-uae-end-without-breakthrough)\n\n### 3. Zelenskyy publicly released Ukrainian military casualty figures for the first time, stating that approximately 55,000 soldiers had been killed.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: Military.com\n- **Summary**: According to Military.com, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently disclosed for the first time the casualties of the Ukrainian army since the start of the war. He stated that approximately 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have heroically sacrificed their lives in the nearly four years of fighting against aggression. This figure is significantly lower than the 140,000 previously estimated by a US think tank. Observers point out that Zelenskyy's decision to release the data at this time is intended to demonstrate the resilience of the Ukrainian army to allies and to garner public support for domestic mobilization and subsequent negotiations. However, he also emphasized that Ukraine is facing extremely serious challenges of troop fatigue and ammunition shortages, and urgently needs continued military assistance from Western partners.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/05/zelenskyy-says-55000-ukrainian-soldiers-have-died-fighting-russias-invasion.html)\n\n### 4. The New START Treaty between the United States and Russia has officially expired, and the global strategic security situation is severe.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: 半岛电视台 (Al Jazeera)\n- **Summary**: According to Al Jazeera, the New START Treaty, the last major treaty limiting nuclear weapons between the US and Russia, officially expired on February 5, 2026. Due to the failure of the two sides to reach an extension or replacement agreement beforehand, the transparency and binding force of global nuclear forces have significantly decreased. Experts believe this marks the near collapse of the international nuclear disarmament framework established since the Cold War. Although the US and Russia have recently resumed military hotlines, the lack of a formal treaty means that the world may be plunged into a new round of nuclear arms race in the coming years, with the risks of strategic miscalculation and conflict constantly rising.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [半岛电视台 (Al Jazeera)](https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/)\n\n### 5.

Erdoğan pointed out that the nuclear negotiations in Oman are the last chance to avoid a full-blown war in the Middle East, and he fears that once war breaks out, its impact will quickly spread throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. Turkey has conveyed a call for restraint to both Washington and Tehran through diplomatic channels and offered Ankara, as a 'neutral port,' to provide further peace-making assistance should negotiations reach a stalemate. This move highlights Türkiye's intention to maintain its regional dominance amidst the current turmoil.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [路透社 (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/turkey-is-doing-its-best-prevent-us-iran-conflict-erdogan-says-2026-02-05/)",
