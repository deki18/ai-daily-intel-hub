In the past 24 hours, the international situation has been incredibly volatile, with several major events impacting the global security architecture occurring simultaneously. First, the diplomatic maneuvering among China, Russia, and the United States has entered a period of high-frequency interaction, with President Xi Jinping holding important communications with Putin and Trump respectively. However, at the same time, the nuclear disarmament framework that has lasted for half a century suffered a major setback, with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) officially expiring today. In the Middle East, US-Iran nuclear negotiations are about to begin, but the Trump administration has issued an unprecedentedly stern military warning; in Abu Dhabi, the glimmer of peace between Ukraine and Russia coexists with the smoke of battle. Heartbreaking news of terrorist attacks has also emerged from the Sahel region of Africa. In the following program, we will provide you with an in-depth look at the key details behind these complex games.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty has officially expired.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-05\n- **Source**: 纽约时报\n- **Summary**: According to reports from Reuters and The New York Times, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia, officially expired at midnight GMT on February 5, 2026. Although diplomatic rumors suggest the US and Russia might temporarily adhere to the original restrictions during the six-month negotiation period, the treaty's legal effect is gone. Russian official Medvedev confirmed that no international law can currently bind the nuclear forces deployments of either country. UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed deep concern, calling it a \"critical moment\" for international security, with the world facing the risk of sliding into a trilateral nuclear arms race. The Trump administration had previously insisted on including China in the new treaty, but China, based on its position of maintaining global balance, has not yet accepted this.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [纽约时报](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/us/politics/new-start-nuclear-arms-control.html)\n  - [2] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations)\n\n### 3.

More significantly, the U.S. European Command confirmed that the U.S. and Russia had agreed to restart high-level military dialogue.

However, the atmosphere before the talks is extremely tense.

Meanwhile, maritime security is also deteriorating. According to The Telegraph, US F-35 fighter jets recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. In preparation for a potential conflict, the Pentagon has announced the deployment of 200 additional troops to the Middle East to bolster defense capabilities.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/05/trump-news)\n  - [2] [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/02/05/how-iran-plans-to-go-to-war-with-us-and-win/)\n\n### 6.

The attack resulted in the deaths of at least 21 Palestinians, including several women, children, and medical personnel. The Israeli military stated that this action was a response to an attack on a border post. Amid the tensions, Israel partially reopened the Rafah crossing, but only allows a very small number of people to cross each day. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) stated that while the reopening of the crossing offers a glimmer of hope, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains severe, and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement faces significant challenges.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [新华社](https://t.me/s/xinhua_news_agency_en?before=472197)\n  - [2] [The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)\n\n### 7.

Against this backdrop, the governments of Azerbaijan and other countries have also reaffirmed their firm support for the one-China principle. However, at the same time, US House committees are still advancing four bills concerning Taiwan, and this political discrepancy has drawn widespread international attention to the stability of future China-US interactions.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Azernews](https://www.azernews.az/region/253927.html)\n  - [2] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/taiwan)\n\n### 8.

In response, the White House is secretly drafting an ambitious global plan to unite allies and establish an independent raw material supply system. This move is seen as an extension of the U.S. \"de-risking\" strategy, aiming to reduce its deep dependence on Chinese raw materials in cutting-edge industries such as electric vehicles and semiconductors. Analysts point out that this strategy could further exacerbate the fragmentation of the global trade system and even trigger a new round of trade frictions.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations)\n\n### 9.

More notably, the US Navy's USS Cincinnati recently docked at the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia. It is worth noting that this base was expanded with Chinese funding and completed last year; the visit of this US warship is interpreted by the outside world as a subtle probe in the geopolitical game in the region.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations)\n\n### 10.

According to the South China Morning Post, China has issued a stern warning to Panama, stating that the move will result in \"heavy political and economic costs.\" Hutchison Whampoa has formally filed a lawsuit with an international arbitration body. Observers point out that Panama's move reflects a clear pro-US policy inclination in some Latin American countries amidst increasingly fierce US-China competition, which could have a profound impact on the region's long-term investment environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations)\n\n### 11.

Russia stated that based on NATO's current troop deployments and readiness posture, Western countries are preparing for actual combat. Although NATO has repeatedly reiterated that it has no plans to send combat troops to Ukraine, Moscow's accusation undoubtedly exacerbates the already fragile security trust between the two sides. Analysts believe that such an escalation of the propaganda war is often a harbinger of military action on the front lines.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [See News](https://see.news/russia-accuses-nato-of-planning-direct-military-intervention-in-ukraine)\n  - [2] [Apple News](https://apple.news/Agm26LrwpSyO3NrdmYKIVOw)\n\n### 13.

This large-scale transfer of heavy equipment is a key part of NATO's long-term military assistance program, aimed at ensuring that the Ukrainian army has sufficient mobility and defensive capabilities in the face of a potential spring offensive. Although Western allies remain hesitant about providing fighter jets, the arrival of this armored force will undoubtedly significantly enhance Kyiv's resilience on the eastern front. It is believed that some of the vehicles have already been deployed near key supply lines.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Apple News](https://apple.news/ArU1QnbWqSli2HkW3zFHIhA)\n\n### 14.
