Collapse of European security architecture: Risk of direct conflict between NATO and Russia surges\n- **Time**: 2026-03-01\n- **Source**: Foreign Affairs\n- **Summary**: A recent academic review article published in *Foreign Affairs* warns that the likelihood of direct conflict between NATO and Russia has significantly increased with the complete collapse of the European security architecture. The article points out that the troop deployments of both sides along the border have reached a point of imminent confrontation, and any friction on the front lines could escalate into a full-scale war across Europe through a chain reaction. Experts believe that due to the lack of an effective crisis communication mechanism, this risk of war caused by structural contradictions has become one of the greatest threats to global peace in 2026, and call on all parties to immediately establish a new emergency collision avoidance mechanism to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/europes-next-war-charap-haukkala)\n\n### 25. Strategic Endurance Game: China and Russia May Avoid Direct Conflict with the United States Over Iran\n- **Time**: 2026-02-18\n- **Source**: Barron's\n- **Summary**: According to a recent policy analysis published by Barron's, despite the high degree of coordination among China, Russia, and Iran in military exercises and diplomacy, policy experts generally believe that Russia and China will strive to avoid a direct head-on military conflict with the United States over the Iran issue at this stage. The analysis shows that Moscow and Beijing prefer to use asymmetric means and economic leverage to counter the US military threat rather than directly getting involved in a Middle East conflict. This cautious strategic endurance reflects that, in the complex international situation of 2026, both countries will prioritize protecting their core interests and maintaining strategic maneuvering, avoiding falling into the trap of a large-scale regional war.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/news/russia-china-unlikely-to-back-iran-against-us-military-threat-8850e6f6)",
