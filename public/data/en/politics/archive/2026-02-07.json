It's February 7, 2026. In the past 24 hours, the global security situation has witnessed a series of landmark yet challenging changes. This episode focuses on \"Great Power Rivalry and Security Restructuring.\" The most worrying news is the formal expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last pillar of US-Russia nuclear arms control that had lasted for half a century. This has instantly plunged the world into a nuclear control \"vacuum,\" triggering deep concerns about an arms race. At the same time, we have also seen glimmers of diplomatic maneuvering: the US and Russia restarted high-level military dialogue in Abu Dhabi after a four-year hiatus, and the US and Iran also engaged in indirect negotiations in Oman, albeit in a \"good\" atmosphere, but with lingering differences. In the Indo-Pacific region, live-fire exercises in the South China Sea and the undercurrents of defense between China, India, and Russia are reshaping the global strategic landscape. Please see the detailed report below.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1. The US and Russia reached an agreement in Abu Dhabi to formally resume high-level military dialogue mechanisms.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: Realtime News, CGTN, ICRT\n- **Summary**: According to reports, the US and Russian militaries held a groundbreaking meeting in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday. General Alexis Grinkovich, Commander of US European Command, represented the US side. The two sides reached an agreement to formally re-establish a high-level military dialogue channel. This marks the first time Washington and Moscow have resumed such direct military communication since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022. Reports indicate that while the two sides had previously maintained a de-conflict hotline, this agreement signifies a substantial return to high-level trust and communication. A US military statement emphasized that this move aims to reduce military miscalculations and prevent local conflicts from escalating into global risks. This breakthrough comes against the backdrop of several recent direct phone calls between the leaders of the two countries.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Realtime News, CGTN, Adaderana.lk](https://www.icrt.com.tw/info_list01.php?&mlevel1=6&mlevel2=12)\n\n### 2. Is the era of nuclear control over over? The New START Treaty between the US and Russia has officially expired.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-06\n- **Source**: CGTN, Adaderana.lk, Il Sole 24 Ore\n- **Summary**: According to CGTN and several international media outlets, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last legal pillar limiting strategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia, will officially expire on February 5, 2026. Because the two sides failed to reach an alternative agreement before the deadline, for the first time in over half a century, the world's two major nuclear powers will operate their nuclear arsenals without treaty constraints. UN Secretary-General António Guterres issued an urgent warning, stating that the risk of nuclear weapons use has reached its highest point in decades. Although there are reports that the US and Russia are discussing a six-month informal compliance agreement in Abu Dhabi, the Kremlin stated that it is difficult to imagine how disarmament commitments can be maintained in the absence of formal legal documents, and the international community is widely concerned that a new round of nuclear arms race has begun.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CGTN, Adaderana.lk](https://www.cgtn.com/politics)\n\n### 3. Indirect negotiations between the US, Iran, and Oman have made progress, but Iran firmly refuses to halt high-enrichment uranium.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Xinhua, CGTN, Al Arabiya\n- **Summary**: According to reports, the United States and Iran held a new round of indirect talks on Friday, mediated by Muscat, Oman. The rare attendance of U.S. Central Command Admiral Brad Cooper highlighted the close connection between the negotiations and Middle East security. President Trump subsequently described the talks as \"very positive\" and planned to continue early next week. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Araqchi made it clear that while the talks were a \"good start,\" Tehran had firmly rejected the U.S. demand to \"stop enriching uranium to 60%.\" Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Iranian oil shipping entities. This \"talking while fighting\" stance makes a full restoration of the Tehran nuclear agreement still a distant prospect.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Xinhua, Realtime News, CGTN, Al Arabiya](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2026/02/07/trump-says-us-talks-with-iran-very-good-more-negotiations-expected)\n\n### 4. Arms control negotiations intensify: The United States accuses China of conducting a secret nuclear test in 2020.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: The Japan Times, SCMP\n- **Summary**: According to a report by The Japan Times, the day after the nuclear disarmament treaty expired, the United States dropped a bombshell at the Geneva disarmament conference. U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, Di Nanno, publicly accused China of using \"decoupling\" technology to conceal a low-yield secret nuclear test in 2020, reportedly yielding hundreds of tons. U.S. Secretary of State Rubio reiterated that any future arms control agreement must include China within a trilateral framework, otherwise U.S. security cannot be guaranteed. Observers point out that this move by the U.S. aims to exert diplomatic pressure on China during the nuclear control \"vacuum.\" China has not yet responded to this latest accusation, but Beijing has repeatedly emphasized its refusal to participate in such unequal trilateral negotiations.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Japan Times, SCMP](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/07/asia-pacific/us-china-secret-nuclear-testing/)\n\n### 5. Russia and India have reached a secret defense agreement involving the Su-57 fighter jet and hypersonic technology.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-07\n- **Source**: Bankingnews.gr\n- **Summary**: According to the Greek media outlet *Bankingnews*, Russia and India recently reached a secret defense agreement that has shaken the international political arena. The agreement stipulates that Russia will provide India with five key assets, including core algorithms for hypersonic weapons, advanced aerodynamics, and nuclear technology. Most notably, the two sides plan to jointly develop and produce the fifth-generation Su-57 fighter jet. This move is seen as an attempt to establish India as a global aerospace hub and create deep synergy in defense systems. Experts analyze that during a period of global geopolitical instability, the accelerated strategic asset binding between Russia and India is clearly a response to a potential ultimatum from the Trump administration regarding the regional situation.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Bankingnews.gr](https://www.bankingnews.gr/index.php?id=853713)\n\n### 6.

In addition to humanitarian issues, representatives from China, the US, and Russia also held closed-door discussions in the UAE on core issues such as global strategic stability.

Latest intelligence indicates that Putin's newly formed \"Unmanned Systems Forces\" have exceeded 87,000 personnel, even surpassing the total strength of the British Army. Shockingly, Ukrainian forces recently discovered a large number of advanced microchips manufactured in the US and Europe in the wreckage of a Russian-made Geran-5 high-speed drone shot down. This suggests serious loopholes in the Western technology supply chain embargo against Russia. Furthermore, the Russian military is deploying suicide drones specifically to target the Ukrainian HIMARS system, indicating a continuous escalation of battlefield technological confrontation.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Daily Mail, News18 Hindi, Kyiv Independent](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/google-news-sitemap1.xml?requestId=)\n\n### 8.

Despite repeated expressions of interest from the Trump administration in acquiring Greenland, NATO allies Canada and France officially opened consulates in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, this week. Diplomatic observers point out that this move aims to support Denmark's sovereignty over the island with a substantial diplomatic presence. Canadian Governor General Mary Simon has stated clearly that Greenland's future should be decided by its people. These actions highlight a collective resistance within NATO to unilateral US intentions and a tightening of its security posture amidst great power rivalry.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Realtime News, ICRT, The National Pulse](https://www.icrt.com.tw/info_list01.php?&mlevel1=6&mlevel2=12)\n\n### 12.

Previously, the United States had moved a carrier strike group to the region, and Iranian officials subsequently warned that any attack by the US military would trigger a \"full-scale war.\" Furthermore, large-scale demonstrations erupted in Saada, Yemen, declaring readiness to fight against US forces. This partial \"blockade\" of Middle Eastern airspace has thrown international air transport into chaos.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Daily Mail, ABNA English](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15494001/KLM-Air-France-suspend-flights-Middle-East-Iran-warns-Trump-US-attack-mean-war.html)\n\n### 13.

As the host, India has made it clear that this summit will focus on promoting structural reforms of core international institutions such as the UN Security Council. While G7 countries like France hope to strengthen cooperation with India to prevent the BRICS from moving towards an \"anti-Western\" confrontation, observers believe that the Global South is seeking to reduce its dependence on a single global hegemon through such regional security systems.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [The Business Standard (TBS News)](https://www.tbsnews.net/thoughts/brics-2026-implications-multipolar-world-1344096)\n\n### 15.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that despite serious differences, such dialogue is the only way to prevent the Middle East from sliding into a \"full-scale war.\" Neighboring countries such as Azerbaijan have also welcomed the negotiations.
