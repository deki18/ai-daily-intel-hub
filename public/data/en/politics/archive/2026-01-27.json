Shelling in the Kherson region caused buildings to catch fire, and infrastructure in Lviv was also affected. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned such actions as undermining the diplomatic process and called on the United States and European partners not to remain silent, but to pressure Moscow through sanctions and a blockade of the Russian oil tanker fleet. DTEK confirmed that Odessa's energy facilities were severely damaged, and repairs would be time-consuming. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev stated that Ukraine's withdrawal from Donbas is a key path to peace.
