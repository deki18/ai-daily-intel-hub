It's a pleasure to bring you the latest global situation analysis at this crucial juncture. Today, we'll delve into 20 major events that have occurred in the past 24 hours and are poised to reshape the future international order. The current global stage is undergoing unprecedented turmoil and transformation: from large-scale air strikes that broke the ceasefire agreement in Eastern Europe to the escalating geopolitical rivalry between the US and Russia in Latin America; from the increasingly tense military standoff in the South China Sea to Europe's strategic transformation towards becoming a \"military superpower\" by shedding its security dependence. Furthermore, the latest moves by the BRICS countries regarding financial sovereignty and the deepening security crisis on the African continent all indicate that the global order is evolving from cyclical fluctuations to structural restructuring. In this program, I will systematically analyze these far-reaching news events, providing insights into the core trends behind the complex situation. Thank you for watching, let's begin today's in-depth report.\n\n## Key Intelligence\n### 1.

Russian troops approach three strategic strongholds in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: 纽约时报 (New York Times)\n- **Summary**: According to the latest battlefield assessment from The New York Times, after more than a year of attrition warfare, the Russian army is now close to capturing three key strategic locations: Khuliypole in the southeast, and Pokrovsk and Milnograd in the northeast. Military experts point out that although the Russian advance is slow, the loss of these towns would provide important urban outposts for the Russian army to use for the assembly of follow-up troops and logistical organization. It is observed that Russia has currently occupied approximately 17% of Ukrainian territory. Analysts believe that Russia is attempting to increase its bargaining power by capturing these strategic hubs before the start of US-mediated peace talks. Currently, the struggle between the two sides in these regions has entered a heated phase.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [纽约时报 (New York Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/russia-ukraine-battlefield-huliaipole-pokrovsk.html)\n\n### 3. The US sets a deadline for peace talks, and the trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi enter a critical phase.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: 纽约邮报 (NY Post), CNN, 马来西亚星报 (The Star)\n- **Summary**: According to reports from CNN and other media outlets cited by this station, the US-mediated trilateral talks between Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi have entered their second round. Zelenskyy revealed that the US has set a June \"deadline\" for both sides of the conflict, demanding an agreement to end the war before then. Meanwhile, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaya Kalas has also presented a list of demands for concessions from Russia as part of the conditions for closing the talks. Furthermore, according to the Malaysian newspaper *The Star*, in order to advance a trade agreement with Washington, India is further avoiding Russian oil and turning to West African and Middle Eastern supplies. This combination of diplomatic and economic measures demonstrates that the international community is working together to exert pressure, attempting to achieve a major breakthrough in the ceasefire by the first half of 2026.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [纽约邮报 (NY Post), CNN, 马来西亚星报 (The Star)](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)\n\n### 4. SpaceX cuts off Russian military access to Starlink networks in occupied territories.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: 纽约邮报 (NY Post), 维基百科 (Wikipedia), 半岛电视台 (Al Jazeera)\n- **Summary**: According to the New York Post, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the company has successfully cut off \"unauthorized\" access to the Starlink satellite system by the Russian military in occupied Ukraine. Previously, Ukrainian military bloggers had repeatedly reported that the Russian military was using Starlink terminals for frontline communications coordination. According to Al Jazeera, this ban has caused communication disruptions for some frontline Russian troops, severely interfering with their operational coordination capabilities. Analysts believe this move resolves the long-standing controversy surrounding the misuse of Starlink in conflict and demonstrates the crucial influence of private technology companies in the modern warfare communications environment.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [纽约邮报 (NY Post), 维基百科 (Wikipedia), 半岛电视台 (Al Jazeera)](https://nypost.com/tag/ukraine-war/)\n\n### 5. Intelligence indicates that the likelihood of Russia launching an attack on NATO in the short term is low.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: Military.com\n- **Summary**: According to a recent intelligence assessment published by the military news website Military.com, a senior European intelligence official stated that despite Russia's long-term military planning, current assessments conclude that Russia is unable to launch a direct military attack on NATO by 2026 or 2027. The report points out that due to the prolonged attrition in the Ukrainian conflict, the Russian military currently lacks the capability to open a second front. Nevertheless, NATO is using this opportunity to strengthen its \"NATO Force Model,\" aiming to replace its existing rapid reaction forces and enhance its overall collective defense architecture. Intelligence experts warn that while the short-term risks are low, European allies still need to be vigilant about Russia's continued infiltration in the cyber and hybrid warfare domains.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/10/emotional-countdown-maiden-launch-of-ariane-64-europes-most-powerful-rocket.html)\n\n### 6.

Russia is currently seeking the extradition of the Russian suspect. This incident is seen as a sign of an escalation in the intelligence struggle between Russia and Ukraine behind enemy lines, drawing widespread attention to the security of high-ranking military leaders.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [德国之声 (DW), 半岛电视台 (Al Jazeera), 纽约邮报 (NY Post)](https://www.dw.com/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789/page-1)\n\n### 7.

According to our analysis, Australia's move aims to enhance its influence in the Indo-Pacific region by strengthening its strategic ties with neighboring Indonesia, and to attempt to counter China's growing military and diplomatic presence in the region. The agreement is seen as a significant breakthrough in Australia's regional security strategy, marking a substantial and deep integration of cooperation between the two countries on security matters.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea)\n\n### 9. Japan and South Korea deepen trilateral security cooperation to address common challenges.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-11\n- **Source**: 南华早报\n- **Summary**: According to a report by the South China Morning Post cited by this station, the defense ministers of Japan and South Korea reached a consensus during their meeting on February 11 to further strengthen trilateral military cooperation with the United States. The report indicates that although bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea are still affected by historical issues, the two countries are accelerating military coordination in the face of escalating regional security risks led by North Korea. Through this enhanced trilateral security architecture, Japan and South Korea are attempting to build a more resilient defense system to address the evolving challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. This meeting is interpreted by the outside world as an important signal that major Asian economies are accelerating their strategic alignment with Washington in the security field.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea)\n\n### 10. Leaked documents reveal Vietnam's highly wary stance towards the United States.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: 南华早报\n- **Summary**: A leaked internal Vietnamese military document, disclosed by the South China Morning Post, reveals that Hanoi holds a cautious, even negative, attitude towards the intentions of the United States. The document characterizes the US as a \"belligerent\" force and warns the military to remain vigilant to prevent the US from finding any pretext to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs or launch an invasion. While the document assesses a low risk of direct armed conflict in the short term, this reflects Vietnam's complex mindset in balancing relations with major powers. Observers analyze that this indicates that behind the seemingly warming US-Vietnam relationship, deep strategic anxieties persist within Vietnam, striving to maintain its independent and autonomous position in the South China Sea power struggle.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea)\n\n### 11.

Near Penang, authorities successfully intercepted two oil tankers belonging to a so-called \"shadow fleet,\" marking the first time in over a decade that the state has disrupted such illegal ship-to-ship oil transshipments. Simultaneously, Malaysia is making every effort to block fuel smuggling routes between Sabah and the southern islands of the Philippines. According to this station, this move aims to safeguard national maritime economic security and resource compliance. Analysts point out that as the global sanctions environment becomes increasingly complex, Malaysia is strengthening maritime oversight to prevent its waters from becoming a haven for illicit trade.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea)\n\n### 12.

A retired Philippine judge suggested that the law must be updated to track down foreign-funded \"internet trolls\" aimed at manipulating domestic public opinion. This move reflects Manila's increasingly assertive stance in its South China Sea diplomacy and cognitive warfare, attempting to use legal means to suppress pro-China voices domestically and strengthen its internal front in its competition with China. This measure indicates that the competition between China and the Philippines has extended to the digital and public opinion spheres.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [南华早报](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea)\n\n### 13. Europe seeks to become a military superpower and significantly increases its spending.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-11\n- **Source**: Telegraph, Atlantic Council\n- **Summary**: According to the UK's Daily Telegraph, former British Chief of the Defence Staff, General Nick Carter, stated clearly on February 11 that Europe must rapidly enhance its military capabilities to become a \"military superpower\" independent of the United States. Meanwhile, a strategic document disclosed by the Atlantic Council reveals that Europe has proposed a massive defense spending plan of up to €800 billion. It is understood that major economies such as Germany have announced plans to double their defense spending within five years, aiming to reach 5% of GDP by 2030. This strategic shift signifies that Europe is attempting to reposition itself within NATO, addressing the uncertain global security situation through a leap forward in its independent defense capabilities.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Telegraph, Atlantic Council](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/02/11/europe-must-be-military-superpower-to-survive-without-us/)\n\n### 14. 2026 Global Defense Market: Localization R&D and New Developments in Aerospace\n- **Time**: 2026-02-10\n- **Source**: LinkedIn, Military.com\n- **Summary**: According to industry media assessments such as Military.com, the global military equipment market is projected to experience significant growth in 2026, driven by countries like China and India. The Asia-Pacific region is focusing on developing localized military supply chains to reduce reliance on Western technology. In the cutting-edge aerospace field, Europe's most powerful rocket, the Ariane 64, was originally scheduled for its maiden flight on February 10th, considered a crucial step in enhancing Europe's independent satellite deployment capabilities. Furthermore, the 2026 Munich Security Report warned that the global security order faces a severe challenge of \"complete disruption\" rather than improvement. With the intertwining of basic military technologies and advanced aerospace technologies, major powers are accelerating the construction of independent and controllable defense industrial systems.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [LinkedIn, Military.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/evaluating-military-hydraulic-cutters-market-current-nq3ye)\n\n### 15.

Lavrov criticized existing structures such as the UN Security Council as \"outdated\" and called for a more sovereign diplomatic system. According to RIA Novosti, the BRICS countries are accelerating the development of the \"BRICS Pay\" distributed payment system, aiming to enhance member states' financial sovereignty through a non-dollarized settlement mechanism, thereby reducing dependence on the Western SWIFT system. This system is considered the most important technological step in the BRICS countries' economic de-dollarization process since the 2025 Rio Summit.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [俄罗斯外交部 (Mid.ru), InoSMI (俄新社)](https://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/2078196/)\n\n### 17.

The meeting also focused on assessing how the Trump administration will adapt AUKUS to its \"America First\" agenda and examining the actual contribution of nuclear submarine deliveries to the Indo-Pacific deterrence landscape. According to this station, the forum also touched upon emerging security topics such as AI security and power grid digitalization, demonstrating that US defense policy is facing profound digital transformation and strategic retrenchment pressures.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [CSIS (战略与国际研究中心)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/aukus-inflection-seizing-opportunity-deliver-deterrence)\n\n### 18. Trump's removal of Maduro has caused severe turmoil in Latin America.\n- **Time**: 2026-02-11\n- **Source**: Time Magazine, ReliefWeb, Security Council Report\n- **Summary**: According to a February 11 in-depth report by Time magazine, the Trump administration revived the Monroe Doctrine, successfully ousting Venezuelan President Maduro through a large-scale military operation and extraditing him to the United States for trial. This move has triggered severe shockwaves in Latin America. According to ReliefWeb, although Maduro is out of power, the process of establishing a stable new government in Venezuela faces numerous difficulties. Colombia has lodged a strong protest against the US action, arguing it violates sovereignty and international law, and has requested a review by the UN Security Council. Experts warn that this event signifies the legitimization of violence as a policy tool, and that Latin America is facing multiple governance crises stemming from US military intimidation, organized crime, and external interference, leaving regional stability teetering on the brink.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Time Magazine, ReliefWeb, Security Council Report](https://time.com/7343169/top-10-global-risks-2026/)\n\n### 19.

Conflicts in Sudan, the Sahel, and eastern Congo have reached a fever pitch. The capture of a strategic town in the DRC by the Rwandan-backed M23 militia has triggered a massive refugee crisis. Meanwhile, Somalia is facing a fierce counterattack from terrorist organizations due to reduced US security support. According to this station's analysis, resource competition and power struggles stemming from delayed elections are the main causes of the conflict. AU member states are seeking coordinated action to address the persistent instability caused by major power intervention and proxy wars. The humanitarian crisis in the region has raised serious concerns within the international community.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Crisis Group, The New Humanitarian, CFR](https://www.crisisgroup.org/brf/africa/b209-seven-peace-and-security-priorities-africa-2026)\n\n### 20. 2026 Global Macroeconomic Risk Warning: Institutional Collapse and Meta-Crisis\n- **Time**: 2026-02-11\n- **Source**: Greater Pacific Capital, CIDOB, Atlantic Council\n- **Summary**: According to the 2026 Global Risks Report released by the Atlantic Council and other institutions, this year has been designated as a \"meta-crisis\" year. The report points out that political instability, accelerated technological development, climate pressures, and financial vulnerabilities are intertwined globally. The main risks stem from political transitions within major powers, leading the global order from cyclical crises to systemic collapse. Latin America faces severe debt pressure, with over 50% of its budget allocated to debt servicing, severely weakening social spending. The lack of unified rules in a multipolar world makes regional conflicts highly susceptible to global spillover effects. Experts point out that the failure of preventative diplomacy is making violence and coercion the norm in international relations, and 2026 will be a crucial year testing global resilience.\n- **References**:\n  - [1] [Greater Pacific Capital, CIDOB, Atlantic Council](https://www.greaterpacificcapital.com/article-inside/the-themes-defining-2026-a-prelude-to-great-reform-or-great-conflict)",
